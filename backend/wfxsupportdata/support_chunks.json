Thank you for your feedback The content you create in Whatfix is designed to be inclusive and fully accessible for all users, including those with disabilities. At Whatfix, ensuring an accessible design results in a positive user experience for all our audiences. Whatfix supports the AA standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) as of 2023. The AA standard is one of the leading specifications defining standards of accessibility for the web. WCAG is broadly broken down into four principles: The Four Principles of Accessibility Perceivable Operable Understandable Robust Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can perceive. User interface components and navigation must be operable. The interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform. Information and the operation of a user interface must be understandable. Users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface. Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. Enabling accessibility for Whatfix To enable this feature, contact support@whatfix.com . What modules are supported for accessibility? Whatfix content such as Flows, Smart Tips, Beacons, Self Help, Task List, Pop-ups, and Surveys are accessibility compliant and screen reader accessible. Note When using a screen reader, Self Help and Task List content is read only after the entire website is read. Non-text content accessibility Any information conveyed by means other than text, such as images and GIFs in the widget, is made accessible using ALT text attributes to provide a short text alternative. ALT text attribute is present while adding images and GIFs in the rich text editor. Whatfix recommends using texts that provide equivalent information relating to the image. Keyboard accessibility Whatfix widgets and interfaces (Self Help, Task List, Flows, tooltips, and Pop-ups) that end users see are accessible from the keyboard. In addition to keyboard accessibility, we also have some shortcuts to support the experience"

Screenreader accessibility Whatfix is compatible with assistive technology, such as screen readers and quick navigation via keyboard strokes. Whatfix content is designed to be compatible with screen readers. For non-text content, Whatfix uses alt text to deliver the information to the audience. Whatfix supports some of the industry's leading screen reader tools, such as JAWS (Job Access With Speech), NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access), and Apple VoiceOver.

Thank you for your feedback The major difference between the Whatfix Guidance Dashboard and Whatfix Studio is that the Dashboard helps you to create, customize, and manage Whatfix content. Once content is created (on either Studio or Dashboard), the Dashboard further helps you to organize, configure, and publish content on your application. On the other hand, the Studio assists you only with content creation. The Whatfix Guidance Dashboard has two parts: Navigation panel Management dashboard Navigation panel The navigation panel comprises of the workspace switcher, Content, Widgets, Guidance analytics, Profile, Style, Tags, Settings, Notifications, Resources, and Chat. UI Label Actions UI Workspace switcher Switch between different accounts or enterprise (ENTs). Content Guide end users to task completion with the help of Content such as a Flow, Video, Image, PDF, Article, or Link. Widgets Provide additional context to end users to enhance their overall user experience using a Widget such as a Beacon, Smart Tip, Pop-up, Self Help, Task List, or Launcher. Guidance analytics View the usage and engagement of Content under Summary and Guides reports. Style Configure the appearance of Content or Widgets. Customize fonts, icons, color schemes, and style elements for Flows, Smart-tips, Beacons, and Launchers. Tags Segment content for specific end users or application pages using Tags such as All tags, Roles, Pages, and Other. Settings Control your Dashboard access, integrate repositories, and oversee the content translation process. Profile Update your profile details, change password, or access Whatfix privacy policy.

In some cases, when a new browser is added to the system, you can just update the same extension file and deploy the extension on the newly added browser. Folders on your dashboard Whatfix enables content creators to group content and widgets inside folders for better management. You can group content or widgets that you want to display to users belonging to the same geography, having the same user roles, and so on. Additional tooltip themes Whatfix provides various customization options that enable you to change the look and feel of your Flows tooltips according to your preferences. You can customize the design of your Flow tooltips by setting, The default theme for all Flows Individual themes for each Flow Whatfix Versioning Whatfix gives enterprises the option to stay on a particular version that affects the end user-impacting features and not upgrade to the latest version as soon as it is released.

You have this choice irrespective of the Whatfix deployment model used on your platform. Content Template Using Content Templates, you can import pre-built and tested content that can be readily used when you log in to your Whatfix account. This reduces your effort in creating Whatfix content from scratch and helps you show content to your end users faster. One-click extensions on Internet Explorer One-click Extensions on Internet Explorer enables you to generate and update your IE extensions on your own from the Whatfix Dashboard. One-click Extensions empowers you to manage all your content updates to the browser extension without needing to depend on the Whatfix support team.

Integration Whatfix to crawl content from the Files section You can integrate Salesforce with Whatfix to fetch and display articles from your Salesforce repository as contextual links in the Self Help widget. Content segmentation on Salesforce Community Whatfix enables content creators to configure segments on Whatfix, using standard Salesforce user properties. Salesforce objects are properties that help Whatfix serve relevant content to Salesforce users based on existing Salesforce properties that help identify different users. Using Salesforce objects help you to show relevant content to your users easily.

You can choose to either fetch all the content or only articles in particular folders.

You can choose to either fetch all the content or only articles in particular folders.

The account level configuration for Beacons is available by default. Flows Flow Close Message/feedback There are instances when an end user may close a Flow while it is playing.

    "chunk_text": "always a good idea to check. Whatfix enables you to handle Flow closures in two ways, Flow Closure Feedback: This enables you to receive feedback from your end users on the reason for Flow closure. Flow Close Message: This enables you to show a message to your end users when they close the Flow. Flow on Standby When a flow fails, Flow on Standby ensures that users can still continue with the process - if they can. A Flow may fail if the element on which a certain step is to display has changed and is not detected. If Whatfix cannot proceed to the next step, Flow on Standby shows an image of what the user should have seen in order to continue with the Flow. The Flow on Standby pop-up is shown in the bottom-right corner of the application page. Multi-level Branch Creation The Multi-level Branch Creation feature enables you to create branched Flows while creating the main Flow or attach an existing flow to the main Flow. This eliminates the need to create flows and then attach them to the main flow while creating it. Pop-up Visual Editor The Pop-up Visual Editor enables you to design and customize the components in Whatfix Pop-ups easily, eliminating the need for JSX code editing. With the Drag-and-Drop feature, content creators can resize Pop-ups, add or delete components, and add customizations directly in the UI. Self Help Content feedback in Self Help Whatfix enables you to provide an in-app feedback icon to enable your end users to give feedback and register their requests and suggestions from within the Self Help widget. Unlike other forms of communication like email support, live chat, and ticketing that redirect the end user to their respective applications, Content Feedback enables users to provide in-app feedback without disturbing their flow of work. End-User Feedback in Self Help End user feedback enables your end users to provide feedback and register their requests and suggestions when they can't find what they are looking for in Self Help. Though there are other ways of communicating, like email support, live chat, and ticketing, that redirect the end-user to their respective applications, the ability to provide End user feedback enables users to provide in-app feedback in their flow of work. Personalize Nudges in Self Help Whatfix enables you to prompt your users to open Self Help after a period of continuous inactivity. Personalized nudges suggest content like articles, Flows, and more to the end user, specific to the user and the page/segment they are currently on. Self-Help Size Adjustment Whatfix enables you to provide your end users with the ability to resize the Self Help widget. End users can minimize or maximize the Self Help widget as per their requirements using the Maximize-Minimize icon. Nested Grouping in Self Help The ability to group content in Self Help helps structure your content so that your end-user can easily understand and navigate through the widget.

New Content Notification in Self Help An essential part of the content creation process is informing your end users about the new content available as and when you create the content. Self Help provides you the ability to notify your end users about any new content created and added in the Self Help. This promotes end user engagement with the widget as well. Carousel animation in Self Help To help you improve the usage of Self Help, Whatfix enables you to catch the attention of your users by animating the Self Help tab. You can also configure a tooltip to appear on cursor hover to show the user a tooltip that introduces them to Self Help. Different configurable animation styles are available using which you can make your users aware of Self Help and show them how they can access it anytime they are looking for more information. QuickRead QuickRead is an AI capability powered by Whatfix that provides summarized answers to your end users' search queries within the Self Help widget. Survey Surveys Whatfix enables you to create surveys and customize the questions and themes depending on your use case. You can create a survey using specific questions that are catered to a particular set of people. Using the feedback received from the survey you can obtain actionable insights and analyze the data to help you improve. Qualitative analysis summary Whatfix's Qualitative analysis summary is an AI-generated report based on the survey responses provided by end users. It generates positive and negative viewpoints after analyzing the survey data. Product Analytics Cohorts as Visibility Rules Cohorts help you group users based on their behavior on the application. Using this analysis, you can target relevant Whatfix content for the particular Cohort to nudge them along the right path. This can be done by including a Cohort as a Visibility Rule to show or not show a Whatfix widget. User Attributes User Attributes provides information about the characteristics of your users. A User Attribute can uniquely identify the user. The attribute could be any alphanumeric ID, Email ID, or a common attribute that is shared amongst various users such as their Department, Business Unit, Location, Country, etc. You can then filter your users based on their characteristics to understand their behavior better. User Action Verification With User Action Verification, Whatfix enables you to view and verify User Actions created on the page. The Verification experience provides content creators with the ability to validate User Actions contextually on the application where they're created, identify, and fix any problems in real-time. This improves the overall quality of the Analytics data generated for User Actions. Event Attributes An event can be defined as an action performed by an end user. Example: a button click, a page view, etc. An event on its own contains less contextual information. Event Attributes enable you to send additional contextual information, for example, the URL and title of the page, the text on a"
