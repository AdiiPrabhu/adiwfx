Learn about managing these common pipeline forecast types. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional (no opportunity splits forecasts), Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud Monthly and Quarterly Pipeline Forecasts In the Forecasts page, the summary shows forecasts for individual months or quarters and a range of months or quarters, depending on the settings your Salesforce admin defines. Your admin can also enable custom periods. Revenue and Quantity Pipeline Forecasts Calculate forecasts on revenue or quantity. Custom Measure Pipeline Forecasts Project sales to best reflect how you do business, using a custom currency or custom number field as the measure in a forecast type. Overlay Splits Forecasts Track revenue from sales team members who help close opportunities but aren’t directly responsible for them. Monthly and Quarterly Pipeline Forecasts In the Forecasts page, the summary shows forecasts for individual months or quarters and a range of months or quarters, depending on the settings your Salesforce admin defines. Your admin can also enable custom periods. Depending on your settings your admin defined, you can forecast up to 15 months, 15 fiscal periods, or 8 quarters in the future or past. If your forecast range includes the current month, period, or quarter, the forecasts page shows the current month, period, or quarter. Otherwise, the first month, period, or quarter of the range is selected. Regardless of whether your company uses monthly or quarterly forecasts, forecast managers can use quotas and adjust their subordinates’ forecasts. Quota and adjustment periods are based on the period settings. The forecast date range becomes the default for all forecast users. Users can keep this default or select a different date range for their own forecasts. After users change their individual forecast date range, admins can’t override them. However, when an admin changes the period display from monthly to quarterly or quarterly to monthly, the change is reflected in all users’ forecasts. SEE ALSO Change Your Forecast Date Range on the Forecasts Page Define a Default Forecast Date Range Revenue and Quantity Pipeline Forecasts Calculate forecasts on revenue or quantity. For example: A sales manager wants to forecast using revenue because the sales vice president sets quota amounts based on the U.S. dollar. A sales rep wants to forecast using quantity because of an incentive to sell 10,000 units of a promotional product. To forecast revenue and quantity for the same data source, such as the Opportunity object, your Salesforce admin can create a forecast type for each, and you can switch between them on the forecasts page. For details about what data each forecast type is based on, see Pipeline Forecast Types.

    "chunk_text": "custom currency or custom number field as the measure in a forecast type. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience in Performance and Unlimited Editions with Sales Cloud, and for an additional cost in Enterprise Edition A measure is used to calculate forecasts. Measures are based on number (quantity) or currency (revenue) fields from the object being that information is gathered from for a forecast. By default, and depending on the object you use, you can calculate forecasts based on revenue using the standard Amount, Revenue, or Total Price fields or by quantity using the Quantity field. Depending on the object you select for a forecast type, one or more of these fields are available to select as the measure for that type. If you have a specific business model that requires the forecast calculations to happen using values from a custom currency or number field that you use to capture revenue or quantity. Depending on the object used for forecasts, this custom field is then available and selected as the measure in a forecast type. Use these field types to define a custom field that is available as a custom measure in a forecast type. Currency: Use a custom currency field to forecast on revenue. For example, create a custom currency field to capture Monthly Recurring Revenue or Annual Contract Value to create forecasts on those values. A custom currency field as a custom measure is available if you base forecasts on Opportunity, Opportunity Product, Opportunity Split, or Line Item Schedule objects. Number: Use a custom number field to forecast on quantity. For example, create a custom number field to capture the number of Net New Subscriptions to create forecasts on those values. A custom number field as a custom measure is available if you base forecasts on the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, or Line Item Schedule objects. When using a custom measure, be sure to select the field that you’re using as a measure as one of the fields available as a column in the opportunity list on the forecast page. If users don’t have access to the custom field used for the measure, they can still see the forecasts based on the measure. They can’t see the values for the custom field in the opportunity list. Notes About Salesforce Classic In Salesforce Classic, you can forecast on custom currency fields via an opportunity split, if the custom field is enabled for opportunity splits. The opportunity owner automatically receives a 100% split for the field. So, if your company doesn’t plan to use splits with the field, the rollup is the same as if no splits existed.

    "chunk_text": "members who are directly responsible for opportunities. To provide more flexibility with how you assign credit for opportunities, you can use overlay splits. Overlay splits help you and other team members allocate credit to overlay sales roles for working on opportunities. Overlay splits can add up to any percentage of the opportunity amount, sometimes exceeding 100%. For example, your sales team can include sales engineers, product specialists, or partners who help close deals but aren’t directly responsible for them. When you forecast on overlay splits, forecast amounts roll up through the role hierarchy based on the opportunity’s Amount field and the overlay team member’s split percentage. Let’s say a sales rep, Allison, has an opportunity that includes an overlay split of 50% for sales engineer Owen, who’s working with Allison on the deal. For Allison, the opportunity Amount field rolls up into her opportunity revenue forecast. Allison’s manager Bryce can view the overlay forecast along with all the other opportunities that his sales engineer team is working on. Bryce can see that Allison is receiving a 100% credit for her deal, which contributes to Allison’s open pipeline total and Bryce’s open pipeline total. If Bryce thinks the deal could close for a higher amount, he can adjust the commit or best case forecast amount."

    "chunk_text": "Adjustments in Pipeline Forecasts A forecast adjustment indicates an assessment about the sales value that a forecast manager or sales rep feels confident of closing during of the forecast period. Adjusting Best Case and Commit forecasts values is a way to accurately gauge where a sales team is on their path to hitting its sales numbers. An adjustment doesn’t change the underlying gross rollup and doesn’t appear in reports. It just adds a layer of detail to a forecast. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud For more accuracy and clarity, managers can indicate which opportunities are part of their committed, adjusted forecast by applying their own judgment to the opportunities in the forecast. See Manager Judgments in Forecasts for details. Your Salesforce admin can enable forecast managers to adjust subordinates’ and child territory forecasts, enable all forecast users to adjust their own forecasts (including territory forecasts they own), or both. Depending on your system settings, forecast managers can: Adjust their own Best Case and Commit forecasts and the forecasts of subordinates one level below them in the forecast hierarchy. The Salesforce mobile app supports owner adjustments only. Adjust forecasts that don’t include adjustments and forecasts that include adjustments made by someone else on their opportunity team. View adjustments that subordinates make at every level below them in the forecast hierarchy. Adjustments made to their subordinates’ forecasts roll up into their own forecasts. For example, let’s say you’re a sales manager who adjusted the forecast of one of your sales reps down from $2,000 to $1,500. Your vice president, who’s your forecast manager, sees $1,500 when viewing your forecast, along with an icon indicating that the forecast contains an adjustment. The vice president can decide to adjust it back to $2,000. Any adjustments that the managers make to subordinates’ forecasts from their own forecast page don’t appear on the subordinate’s forecasts page. Instead, the managers see that subordinate’s forecasts and any adjustments that the subordinates made to their own forecasts or forecasts of their subordinates. For example, let’s say you’re a vice president of sales. On your own forecasts page, you see a July Best Case forecast of $1,250 (including a $50 adjustment that you made) for one of your first-level subordinates, a sales manager. However, when you view the sales manager’s forecasts page, the July Best Case forecast is $1,200, because it doesn’t include your adjustment. If a manager and a subordinate adjust the same forecast, only the manager’s adjustment rolls up the forecast hierarchy. NOTE While you’re viewing a forecasts page, your subordinates can be adjusting their own forecasts or editing related opportunities. Or you can adjust one of your subordinates’ forecasts from your own page. All these events change forecasts. To view the most recent forecasts, click Refresh. In Lightning Experience, a timestamp shows the date and time when the forecasts page was refreshed. In-progress data updates"

Adjustment Details Your Salesforce admin can configure adjustments to show only in a window when you hover over a forecast cell, or to break out adjustment amounts into separate columns.

NOTE If there are changes in the last 7 days, you can also see the details about those changes when hovering over the cell. However, the icon doesn’t indicate those types of changes. Adjustments and Multiple Active Forecast Types If multiple forecast types are active, each forecast type maintains separate adjustments. For example, if opportunity revenue and quantity forecasts are enabled, you can adjust forecasts for each type. However, adjustments made in the opportunity revenue-based forecast aren’t shown as adjustments in any other forecast type. So if you adjust an opportunity revenue forecast from $100,000 to $90,000, and then switch your forecast view, you don’t see an equivalent adjustment value in the opportunity quantity forecast. If you change the forecast view back to the opportunity revenue forecast, you see your adjustment of $90,000. Adjustments and Product Family Forecasts If you use product family forecasts, you can’t adjust your own product family forecasts in Salesforce Classic. If users adjust their product family forecasts in Lightning Experience, not every total in the Salesforce Classic forecasts grid reflects the adjustments. Adjustments When Opportunities Move Between Forecast Categories When an opportunity moves from one forecast category to another, such as from Pipeline to Best Case, the unadjusted raw forecasts change for each of those rollups. However, forecasts with adjustments don’t change in the summary on the forecasts page. To account for changes in the stage of opportunities, update or remove your adjustments to each forecast rollup.

Then, define forecast types that group forecast rollup totals by the picklist’s values. Grouping forecasts using a custom picklist is available for forecast types created in Spring ’24 or later that are based on the Opportunity and Opportunity Product objects. From Object Manager, add a custom single-selection picklist to the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, or Product object. You can also use a preexisting custom single-selection picklist. Make sure the picklist is available on the page layouts that your sales reps and forecast managers use. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Forecasts Settings, and then select Forecasts Settings. In the Available Forecast Types section, create a forecast type based on the Opportunity or Opportunity Product object. If you added the picklist to the Product object, create the forecast using the Opportunity object. As you complete the forecast type setup flow, select the picklist to group by and select the values from the picklist to show in the forecast type. You can select up to 50 values from the identified custom picklist to include in the forecast. To see the group selection for each opportunity, add the picklist field as a column in the opportunity list for the forecast type. Save your changes, and then activate the forecast type. Group Pipeline Forecasts by Product Family If your company groups its products and services into product families such as Hardware and Software, you can group forecasts using families instead of a custom picklist.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: all editions Primary Account In Lightning Experience, you can merge contacts that have different primary accounts unless the contact is associated with a portal user. In Salesforce Classic, you can merge only contacts that have the same primary account. The primary account is the account listed in the Account Name field on the contact record. Data Privacy Preferences When you merge duplicate leads or contacts, you also associate a data privacy record with the primary record. If you selected the option to retain the most recently updated data privacy record for merging leads and contacts, we associate the correct record for you. Otherwise, we prompt you to select the one you want to retain for the records you merge. Redundant Relationships If you try to merge contacts that are indirectly related to the same account, Salesforce displays a message suggesting that you remove the redundant relationship. On contact records, indirect relationships are managed from the Related Accounts related list. Contact Roles When contacts are merged, contact roles on non-master contacts lose their status as the primary contact. Portal Users When you use Lightning Experience to merge contacts associated with portal users, the portal user status isn’t shown during merging. The merged record retains the portal user status of the primary record. When you use Salesforce Classic to merge contacts associated with portal users, the portal user status is shown during merging. You choose the portal status you want to retain in the merged record. In both Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, the primary contact must be associated with a portal user. The merged contact retains the portal user status of the primary contact. If a non-master contact is associated with a portal user, that user is deactivated. Campaigns When duplicate contacts that are members of different campaigns are merged, Salesforce retains the Member Status Updated date for each campaign the merged contact is a member of. Related Items, Chatter Feeds, and Attachments When duplicate records are related to items such as campaigns or activities, Salesforce relates the items to the merged record, with some exceptions. Chatter feeds are retained from the primary record only. Salesforce Files attached in the Chatter feed or Files related list are retained in the merged record. Hidden and Read-Only Fields Salesforce retains any data in hidden or read-only fields, such as sharing settings from the primary record. Hidden fields aren’t shown while you merge.

Also, manual sharing from the primary record is applied to the merged account. Redundant Relationships If you try to merge accounts that are indirectly related to the same contact, Salesforce displays a message suggesting that you remove the redundant relationships. On account records, indirect relationships are managed from the Related Contacts related list. Related Items, Chatter Feeds, and Attachments When duplicate records are related to items such as campaigns or activities, Salesforce relates the items to the merged record, with some exceptions.

Mobile Device Support You can't use the Salesforce mobile app to merge duplicate accounts. Hidden and Read-Only Fields Salesforce retains any data in hidden or read-only fields, such as sharing settings, from the primary record. Hidden fields aren't shown while you merge. A merged record retains the Created By user and Created Date from the oldest record merged, regardless of which record is the primary. The record shows the merge date as the Last Modified By date.

To create the most accurate forecast possible, apply your judgment about whether you consider an opportunity part of the forecast total. Applying your judgment as a forecast manager provides visibility into which deals you have the highest confidence to close and a more accurate picture of your forecast to managers above you in the hierarchy. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud Forecast managers can apply judgment to opportunities that their direct reports own. When reviewing the Commit forecast category rollup value, the total of the opportunities indicated as part of the forecast is shown. In single category rollups, the IN total is the total of any committed opportunities judged as IN that roll up through the forecast manager’s hierarchy. In cumulative category rollups, the IN value also includes Closed Won opportunities, because committed and closed won opportunities roll up into the Commit Forecast column. Judgment totals are available for the current forecast period. Opportunity Split Forecast Types The forecast manager’s judgment applies to their percentage of the opportunity and rolls up through the forecast hierarchy. If manager judgments differ on an opportunity that’s split, higher-level managers in the hierarchy see Mixed in the rolled-up forecast. Mixed indicates that management owners aren’t aligned on whether the opportunity is considered part of the forecast. Mixed also shows when only some forecast managers in the split relationship have applied judgment, but not all. Multiple Active Forecast types The forecast manager’s judgment applies at the opportunity level. If a forecast manager uses multiple forecast types when reviewing and working with their forecasts, their judgment for an opportunity applies to each type. Product Family Forecasts For forecast types based on product family, the judged total is available on the overall product family row and not at the forecast period row. When Opportunities Move Between Forecast Categories If an opportunity moves from one category to another, the judgment moves with it, assuming the forecast manager doesn’t also change. Apply Manager Judgment to Opportunities in Pipeline Forecast To create the most accurate forecast possible, apply your judgment as a forecast manager about whether you consider a subordinate’s opportunity part of your forecast. Then you have the details about the total value of the opportunities when you review and adjust the total Commit forecast. Manager Judgment Deletions in Pipeline Forecasts Review the scenarios that cause manager judgments to be deleted from opportunities in a pipeline forecast. Who Can Apply Manager Judgments in Pipeline Forecasts Forecast judgments at the opportunity level provide an assessment about the opportunities that the forecast owner feels confident to close during the forecast period. Your system settings and your place in the forecast hierarchy determines if you can view and make judgments. SEE ALSO Who Can Adjust Pipeline Forecasts"

There are some things to be aware of when using contact roles. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: all editions IMPORTANT In Salesforce Classic, contact roles are available for accounts, opportunities, cases, and contracts. In Lightning Experience, contact roles are available for opportunities, contracts, and cases. Although contact roles work more or less the same for each available object, they work independently. Therefore, you need to set them up and use them separately for each object. To view the contact records that are listed in the Contact Roles related lists, you must have the proper user permissions and sharing access to those records. When contacts are merged, contact roles on non-master contacts lose their status as the primary contact. When you add contact roles to opportunities, you can save up to 200 contacts at a time. All contacts that are associated with the record’s account are prepopulated. You can also search for other contacts that are not associated with the record’s account. A single contact or person account can have a different contact role on different records. Adding person accounts to contact roles on accounts is available but not recommended. Instead, use the Partners related list to associate person accounts to other accounts. When you create an opportunity from a contact detail page, that contact becomes the primary contact on the opportunity. However, a contact role isn’t automatically assigned. On case contact roles, the Primary option isn’t available. The primary contact on a case is always the contact listed under Contact Name in the Case Detail section."

    "chunk_text": "Get to Know Salesforce Campaigns Many cross-functional teams struggle to adequately communicate and hand off important data and resources. Use Salesforce campaigns to bridge the gap between marketing and sales and promote your successes to internal stakeholders. You can define campaign types, organize assets, add members, create campaign hierarchies, and then track and report on campaign performance. Tools like Campaign Influence and Einstein Attribution help attribute success and optimize future campaigns. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions By using campaigns, you can: Identify where money goes and where it comes in. Communicate ROI to internal stakeholders. Understand how leads and contacts engage at multiple touchpoints. Make smarter budgeting decisions based on past campaign performance. Get access to Account Engagement engagement data, Einstein AI tools, and more. Tour the Campaigns Object To get familiar with the data in your campaign records, let’s take a tour of the Campaign object. How Campaigns Can Help You can use Salesforce campaigns in a variety of businesses and marketing processes throughout the marketing cycle. Campaigns help organize your marketing plan and assets. Plus, when you set up your campaign records effectively, they contain valuable data that you can use to optimize future efforts. Use Campaigns with Other Clouds For a more comprehensive picture of your marketing-to-sales funnel, you can align Salesforce campaigns to Marketing Cloud Engagement and Account Engagement. Understand Campaign Hierarchy To organize and link individual marketing campaigns together, use parent and child relationships to associate campaigns in a campaign hierarchy. You can think of a hierarchy as a family tree. Metrics from child campaigns roll up to the parent, so you can access data for individual campaigns or in aggregate. You can build a hierarchy to focus on marketing channels, fiscal periods, long-term projects, or any other factor that makes sense for your business. A campaign hierarchy can support up to five levels. Getting Started Worksheet Before you begin creating campaigns, think about your business goals, existing processes, and the tactics that your marketing team uses most. Campaign management is most effective when it aligns with the way your business already works. A Salesforce admin can help customize the tactical components of your campaigns that marketers use every day. Campaign Fields A campaign has the following fields, listed in alphabetical order. Depending on your page layout and field-level security settings, some fields may not be visible or editable. Things to Know About Campaigns Review these considerations before you work with campaigns.

It uses the Campaign Influence object to make connections across contacts, campaigns, and opportunities. Campaign Influence 1.0 isn’t supported in Lightning Experience. To track influential campaigns in Lightning Experience, switch to Customizable Campaign Influence. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions IMPORTANT For new users, Customizable Campaign Influence is enabled by default. Not sure which version of Campaign Influence you have? Search Setup for campaign influence, and check the available pages. If the Model Settings page appears, you’re using Customizable Campaign Influence. Primary Campaign Source Only one campaign in a related list can be marked as the primary campaign source, because it allocates 100% of the attribution to the selected campaign. When you mark a campaign as primary, it’s added to the Primary Campaign Source field on the opportunity. For more flexibility, check out Customizable Campaign Influence. Opportunity statistics, such as Opportunities in Campaign and Won or Closed values, appear only on the campaign marked as the primary source. Opportunity statistics don’t appear on other influential campaign records. Before you select a primary source campaign, consider workflows or Apex rules that are triggered by changes to an opportunity record. Auto-Association Settings With Campaign Influence 1.0, you can choose whether to enable auto-association. When it’s turned on, influential campaigns are automatically added to an open opportunity record when a campaign’s related contact is assigned an opportunity contact role. You can also apply rules that specify which types of campaigns are considered influential. In the Campaign Influence Eligibility Limits section, the time frame field specifies a time period during which a campaign is considered influential. The time frame is the number of days between the date that a contact is added to a campaign and when a related opportunity is created. Eligibility limits work only when a contact is related to a campaign first and then assigned an opportunity contact role. Auto-association ignores contacts who are added to campaigns after the related opportunity is created. EXAMPLE Admin Kim enables auto-association and enters a Campaign Influence time frame of 10 days. Customer Gerrie engages with an email and their contact record is added to the New Services campaign on June 15. The next day, Gerrie talks to Parul in Sales, and Parul adds them to an opportunity and assigns an opportunity contact role. The New Services campaign is automatically added to the Campaign Influence related list.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: all editions SALESFORCE CAMPAIGNS + ACCOUNT ENGAGEMENT Socks Unlimited supplies socks to a variety of retailers in the United States. The company wants to nurture prospects that they met at a recent trade show in Boston. Marketing manager Priya wants to use Engagement Studio to automate the process. Before Priya builds her engagement program, she creates a Salesforce campaign called Trade Shows. She uses this campaign as a parent campaign and creates child campaigns to track events including NE Trade Show 2021. In Account Engagement, she builds an engagement program that sends a series of emails, forms, and event invitations. When Engagement Studio sends an email, the prospect is added as a campaign member to NE Trade Show 2021 with a Sent status. Other actions update the custom campaign member status each time the prospect interacts with another asset. Another action scores prospects as they move through the program. When a prospect’s score is good enough to be considered marketing qualified, the prospect is assigned to a Socks Unlimited sales rep. Then, tracking continues into the sales funnel. When it comes time to report her progress, Priya can use Engagement Studio reporting together with Salesforce campaign reports to identify where the trade show prospects are responding best. The rollup metrics in the hierarchy that she created can also tell her whether the Boston trade show yielded more engagement than other events that her team attended. SALESFORCE CAMPAIGNS AND MARKETING CLOUD ENGAGEMENT Floor manager Don just learned that his car dealership is finally getting more inventory of the newest hatchback that people come in asking about. He wants to set up his sales reps for success. They need high-quality, branded content so that they can follow up with folks who expressed interest. He calls Liliana in corporate marketing and finds out that she’s already a step ahead. A while back, Liliana used Distributed Marketing tools to create a personalized customer journey in Marketing Cloud Engagement and connected it to a Sales Cloud campaign. She gives Don the name of the campaign, which he can share with his reps. Now anyone with access to the Sales Cloud campaign can add a campaign member and customize the email content from Liliana’s marketing journey. Don’s potential customers get great looking content from his sales reps, and Liliana can track the journey metrics and campaign performance from corporate.

You can activate New Order Save Behavior in Salesforce settings. In Salesforce Summer ’20 and earlier, Salesforce didn’t run custom application logic when an order product update caused a change to the parent order. For example, a new order product causing a change to the order’s total amount. Users who wanted to enforce custom applications in these scenarios required further customizations for a workaround. When New Order Save Behavior is active, Salesforce evaluates and runs these customizations whenever an order product update changes the parent order. Order and order product validation rules Order and order product Apex triggers and classes Flows, including processes We recommend that you activate New Order Save Behavior. If it isn’t activated, order field tracking doesn’t track changes on orders when order products are modified for order amounts. When you activate New Order Save Behavior, we recommend you test your custom application logic to ensure that it still works as intended. IMPORTANT Packages don't support the New Order Save Behavior release update by default. Package providers can test and configure their packages to support the new behavior. If you use a package involving orders, wait for confirmation from your package provider before enabling the release update. You can install packages that support the Old Order Save Behavior on subscriber orgs that have enabled the New Order Save Behavior. However, we recommend you to verify that your package works with the new order save behavior. Starting Summer ‘21, Salesforce CPQ and Salesforce Billing support both New Order Save Behavior and Old Order Save Behavior. Installations of Salesforce CPQ and Salesforce Billing Summer ’21 work on subscriber orgs regardless of the subscriber org’s order save behavior. If Salesforce CPQ and Billing is installed while the New Order Save Behavior release update is enabled, previous versions of Salesforce CPQ and Billing sometimes don’t work correctly. Starting Winter ‘25, the New Order Save Behavior is enabled by default in all new customer orgs. However, you can choose to disable it. EXAMPLE Your order has an Apex Trigger rule that updates the custom field NeedApproval__c to True if the order amount is greater than $10,000. trigger OrderTrigger on Order (before update) { for(Order ord : Trigger.new) { if (ord.TotalAmount > 10000) { ord.NeedApproval__c = true; } } } If New Order Save Behavior is active, Salesforce runs the rule whenever you add or edit an order product on the order. If New Order Save Behavior is inactive, Salesforce runs the rule only when you insert or update the order.

You can create multiple reduction orders for a single order, but you can’t create a single reduction order for multiple orders.

List email and mass email are designed for small-scale sales campaigns and basic marketing emails. How do I add contacts and leads to campaigns? Your company’s campaigns typically target existing customers (contacts) and prospective customers (leads). You can associate contacts and leads with campaigns as campaign members. How can I calculate the ROI for my campaigns? The Campaign ROI Analysis Report is on the Reports tab in the Campaign Reports folder. It calculates your campaigns' performance by return on investment (ROI) and average cost. How can I track which opportunities resulted from campaigns? One key benefit of campaigns is the ability to track how much business has been generated from each campaign. When you create an opportunity, you can fill in the Primary Campaign Source field to indicate that the opportunity resulted from a specific campaign. How is Campaign influence different from ROI reports? Campaign influence tracks pipeline and revenue for multiple campaigns, and ties all campaigns of a contact role to that opportunity for pipeline and ROI reporting. It's helpful for longer deal cycles when more than one campaign contributes to a closed deal or a converted lead. Who has access to Campaigns? Depending on your sharing settings, users in your org can view campaigns, view the advanced campaign setup, or run campaign reports. However, only designated marketing users with the appropriate user permissions can create, edit, and delete campaigns and configure advanced campaign setup."

    "chunk_text": "About Advanced Currency Management Advanced currency management allows you to manage dated exchange rates within opportunities using Salesforce. Dated exchange rates allow you to map a conversion rate to a specific date range. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions USER PERMISSIONS NEEDED To enable advanced currency management: Customize Application To view currencies: View Setup and Configuration To change currencies: Customize Application For example, the exchange rate on January 1 was 1 USD to 1.39 AUD, but on February 1, it changed to 1 USD to 1.42 AUD. Your opportunities that closed between January 1 and February 1 use the first exchange rate (1 = 1.39), while opportunities that closed after February 1 used the second exchange rate (1 = 1.42). Dated exchange rates are defined using a start date and a conversion rate. Each rate is in effect until either the end of time or the day before the next start date for that currency. The time between one start date and the next start date is called the exchange rate date range. These ranges can be as small as a day and as large as all time. To enable or disable advanced currency management, see Enabling or Disabling Advanced Currency Management. When advanced currency management is first enabled, your existing exchange rates automatically become the first set of dated exchange rates. These rates are valid for all time, until you define another set of exchange rates. If you disable advanced currency management, all currency conversions use the static conversion rate. See Edit Conversion Rates. Advanced Currency Management Considerations Dated exchange rates are used for opportunities, opportunity products, opportunity product schedules, campaign opportunity fields, opportunity splits, and reports related to these objects and fields. Dated exchange rates are not used in forecasting, currency fields in other objects, or currency fields in other types of reports. Dated exchange rates are also not used when calculating formula fields with a formula return type of “Currency.” Salesforce orgs with advanced currency management support roll-up summary fields between two advanced currency management objects. For example, roll-up summary fields are supported from an opportunity line item object to its opportunity object, because both are advanced currency management enabled. However, if you enable advanced currency management, you can’t create roll-up summary fields that calculate currency on the opportunity object rolling up to the account object. You also can’t filter on the opportunity currency field on the account object. All existing currency-related roll-up summary fields on the opportunity object that summarize objects that don’t support dated exchange rates are disabled and their values are no longer calculated. If your org enables advanced currency management, delete any currency roll-up summary fields using opportunities and accounts or opportunities and custom objects. Campaign opportunity fields use dated exchange rates when calculating the amount in the campaign currency. However, they don’t use dated exchange rates when converting those amounts to the user currency. Cross-object formulas always use"

Each object can have one path per record type. There is no limit to the number of paths that you can create per org. If your org has a large combination of objects, record types, and picklists, path creation can take a couple of minutes. To translate Guidance for Success content, use the Path Step Rich Text component in Translation Workbench. You can’t include images in path packages. You can’t package custom values in standard picklist fields on paths. Path appears for records where the running user has permission to view the record, record type, and all fields used in the path. Celebrations (Confetti Animations) When you configure celebrations in a path, the confetti animation is also triggered in kanban views configured for the same object, record type, and picklist. Celebrations don’t work on the lead status Converted. Celebrations don’t support field values with a comma in the API name. Delete the comma from the API name or re-create the value. A comma in the label for a field value is OK. Editing and Validation The record type and owner fields aren’t editable in the Key Fields panel. To transfer ownership, users must use the Details tab. To change the record type, they must use the Change Record Type action. If a path exists for a record type that you delete, the path is also deleted. You can’t use the page layout to require different fields in different steps. However, you can set up validation rules based on a path step. Validation messages appear as page-level messages even if you configure the rules to show them near the fields. If the Opportunity Stage field is in use in field dependencies, all Stage values are shown when selecting the last stage Closed, instead of showing only Closed/Won and Closed/Lost options. When you add a Path component to a dynamic form, a field’s configuration on the page layout overrides the UI Behavior value selected for it on the dynamic form. For example, Opportunity Information Description is set as required on the Opportunity page layout but has a UI Behavior value of None on the dynamic form. The Path component treats the Opportunity Information Description field as required.

    "chunk_text": "What happens when I convert leads? When you convert a lead, Salesforce creates an account, contact, and optionally an opportunity, using information from the lead you’re converting. If the lead was also a campaign member, Salesforce associates the campaign member record with the new contact. The converted lead becomes a read-only record. If existing accounts and contacts share the names specified on the leads, you can choose to update the existing accounts and contacts. Salesforce adds information from the lead into empty contact fields; Salesforce doesn’t overwrite existing account and contact data. When you convert a lead to a new or existing contact, Salesforce adds the contactCreatedByLead or contactUpdatedByLead system field to the contact. You can see these fields in the History related list for the contact. The value of these fields is null; their presence on a contact indicates that the contact was created or updated from a lead. Salesforce attaches all activities from the converted lead to the resulting account, contact, and opportunity, except activities initiated from a Sales Engagement cadence. If you delete one of these activities from any of the resulting records, Salesforce also removes it from the other records. To restore an activity to all resulting records, remove it from the recycle bin. You can assign the owners of these new records, and schedule follow-up tasks. When you assign new owners, only the open activities are assigned to the new owner. If you have custom lead fields, that information can be inserted into custom account, contact, or opportunity fields. Your admin can also set up your custom lead fields to populate custom account, contact, and opportunity fields automatically. You can’t view converted leads, unless your admin has assigned you the View and Edit Converted Leads permission. However, converted leads do appear in lead reports. Salesforce updates the Last Modified Date and Last Modified By system fields on converted leads when picklist values included on converted leads are changed. After it’s converted, a lead record is no longer searchable, unless your admin assigned you the View and Edit Converted Leads permission. The new account, contact, or opportunity record created from the converted lead is searchable."

Here are a few tools the workbook offers to help you avoid data-entry errors. When a campaign has the same name in both apps and you add it to the Connect tab, the worksheet auto-fills the matching campaign. When a row is complete, it turns green. When a campaign is added to the Connect tab, its corresponding row is highlighted in its original tab, to indicate it's already been mapped.

In Account Engagement, select Marketing and then Campaigns. In the Lightning app, select Account Engagement Campaigns. This tab isn’t visible by default—an admin must add it. Click Connect Campaigns with Excel and download the workbook. In the Pardot tab of the workbook, copy a value from the Name column. Then, paste it into the Pardot Name column of the Connect tab.

In the Lead Views section, select a list view from the dropdown list to go directly to that list page, or click Create New View to define your own custom view. To view the leads in a queue, choose that queue list from the dropdown list. For every queue your administrator creates, Salesforce adds a corresponding queue list view. The org-wide sharing model for an object determines the access users have to that object’s records in queues: Public Read/Write/Transfer: Users can view and take ownership of records from any queue. Public Read/Write or Public Read Only: Users can view any queue but only take ownership of records from queues of which they’re a member or, depending on sharing settings, if they’re higher in the role or territory hierarchy than a queue member. Private: Users can only view and accept records from queues of which they’re a member or, depending on sharing settings, if they’re higher in the role or territory hierarchy than a queue member. Regardless of the sharing model, users must have the “Edit” permission to take ownership of records in queues of which they’re a member. Salesforce admins, users with the “Modify All Records” object-level permission for Cases or Leads, and users with the “Modify All Data” permission, can view and take records from any Case or Lead queue regardless of their membership in the queue.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: All Editions USER PERMISSIONS NEEDED To add or edit opportunity contact roles: Edit on opportunities AND Read on contacts To view opportunity contact roles: Read on opportunities and contacts NOTE This information applies to opportunity contact roles, a subset of contact roles. To add and edit opportunity contact roles, users must have read access to the Account Name field on the Contact object. To view the contact records in the Opportunity Contact Role related list, you must have the proper user permissions and sharing access to those records. A single contact or person account can have a different opportunity contact role on multiple records. In Salesforce Classic, if a contact has multiple opportunity contact roles on one opportunity, the Opportunities related list on the Contact record shows duplicates. In Lightning Experience, the related list doesn’t show duplicates. When contacts are merged, opportunity contact roles on non-master contacts lose their status as the primary contact. If you have an opportunity with the same opportunity contact roles for multiple contacts, and the contacts are merged, the opportunity contact roles aren’t merged. After the contacts merge, the original opportunity contact role records still exist. The opportunity contact roles have the same contact, opportunity, and role. For example, let’s say your opportunity had three Decision Maker opportunity contact roles, but each one was a different contact. The three contacts merged into one contact, but your opportunity still has the same three contacts with the same opportunity contact roles. When you delete and later undelete an opportunity or contact, the opportunity contact role is also undeleted. Opportunity contact roles can’t be undeleted independently. When an opportunity or contact is undeleted, the related opportunity contact roles don’t keep their primary status. Inserting and updating multiple opportunity contact roles at one time works differently in Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience. In Salesforce Classic, each record is inserted or updated individually. If you use triggers that execute when you insert or delete multiple opportunity contact roles, a separate trigger executes for each record. In Lightning Experience, all of the records are inserted or updated together. If your triggers execute when you insert or update multiple contact roles, one trigger executes for all of the records in a bulk transaction. When you create multiple opportunity contact roles by inserting multiple opportunities with the ContactId field populated, Salesforce creates each contact role in an individual transaction. A separate trigger executes for each contact role record."

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Contact Manager, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions When you use Contacts to Multiple Accounts, each contact still requires a primary account (the account in the Account Name field). The contact and its primary account have a direct relationship. But you can add other accounts to the contact. These secondary account-contact relationships are indirect. Contacts to Multiple Accounts works with person accounts. That means a person account can be either a related contact on a business account or a related account on a contact. A person account can also be related to another person account as either a related contact or related account. When you relate a person account to an account or contact, the relationship is always indirect. That’s because person accounts don’t have primary accounts, so person accounts can’t be directly related to business accounts. And person accounts can't be primary accounts for contacts, so person accounts can't be directly related to contacts. When Contacts to Multiple Accounts is enabled, an Account Contact Relationship record is created for each contact with a primary account, and for each person account. Contacts to Multiple Accounts can't be enabled with the Metadata API. TIP We recommend turning on this feature outside of regular business hours to ease setup if your org has a large number of contacts. EXAMPLE John Smith is president of Acme Corporations, and Acme is the account on his contact record. But John is also involved with the nonprofit media organization Greendot Media. By adding Greendot Media as a related account on John’s contact record, you can track this other relationship. John is considered a direct contact to Acme because Acme is the account on his contact record. And he’s considered an indirect contact to Greendot Media and any other accounts that he becomes related to. John also appears on the Related Contacts related list for Greendot Media and any other accounts that he’s indirectly related to.

The quota value in the Total row is the sum of all month or quarter values. You can edit direct subordinates’ quotas only (“Manage Quotas” permission required)—not your own. In territory forecasts, quotas can be assigned to the forecast manager if one is defined. If the territory doesn’t have a forecast manager, quotas can be assigned to a user who is a member of the territory."

In Setup, go to Opportunity Team Settings and enable Team Selling. Next, use the Quick Find box to locate Opportunity Splits Settings. To tailor opportunity splits to your business process, you can make these customizations. Rename or deactivate the default revenue and overlay splits, which are based on the Opportunity Amount field. Define another currency field for splits, and specify whether splits on that field must total 100%. To do so, click + Add a new split type. Click Save. Help users create splits faster by selecting Let users add members to opportunity teams while editing splits. Otherwise, owners must add coworkers to an opportunity team before adding them to a split. Select the opportunity page layouts where you want to include the Opportunity Splits related list. You can also include the related list in page layouts that users have personalized. To start splits enablement, click Save. We send an email with the status throughout the process, and notify you when splits are enabled. After you enable splits, set up the Opportunity Splits component on your opportunity record page so your sales teams can view and work with opportunity splits and opportunity product splits. See Create and Configure Lightning Experience Record Pages in Salesforce Help. The opportunity owner records added during splits enablement use more data storage. If the opportunity owner isn’t on the opportunity team, the opportunity owner is added to the team during the splits enablement. The owner is assigned 100% of the split amount. Users can adjust the amount on splits that they create. SEE ALSO Monitor Data and Storage Resources Add Opportunity Product Splits Set Up Audit History for Splits and Opportunity Teams"

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions USER PERMISSIONS NEEDED To create, edit, or delete campaign member statuses: Read and Edit on campaigns AND Marketing User selected in User Detail Planning for Campaign Member Statuses Before you start using campaign member statuses, think about your campaign types and which statuses you want to include for each type. For example, statuses for an event can include Invited, Registered, and Attended. Do you want to include Declined or No Show? For consistency, we recommend that you create a single set of campaign member statuses for each type of campaign that you run. Document the statuses for internal use. To allow users to create their own campaign member statuses, an admin adds the Campaign Member Statuses related list to campaign records. Using the Campaign Member Status Field From a campaign’s Campaign Member Statuses related list, users can create a status, select a default status, and indicate whether the status is considered a response. Salesforce tallies response records together in the Responses in Campaign field. When someone interacts with your campaign, their member status doesn’t change automatically. After you create campaign member statuses, you can apply a status to campaign member records manually, in bulk, or with Account Engagement automation tools. You can use the Campaign Member Status field to filter and sort your campaign data. For example, target your audiences based on campaign member status, or generate reports to track RSVPs or awareness. Updating Campaign Member Statuses If you plan to use campaign member status as a filtering mechanism in reporting or automation, don’t edit the available member statuses and their settings. If you change the status value or its response setting, it can cause problems where the status is in use and trigger statistics recalculation throughout your reports. TIP To encourage consistency, document your default campaign statuses for internal users.

You may not have configured data sync, you may have the wrong objects or custom objects. You may have Org configurations that are incompatible with the requirements of the app. The following sections can help you troubleshoot these common issues. Understand Enablement Steps Revenue Insights dashboards are created by CRM Analytics with the following flow: The Enablement Wizard runs. Placeholder datasets and dashboards are created. Recipes are generated. Extended metadata is applied to the populated datasets. If the recipe fails, the app creation process will not complete successfully. The impact of this may manifest as dashboard errors, format issues in displayed data, or other unexpected behavior Failure due to field availability or Org configuration If the recipe failure can be corrected by changing the Org configuration (for example, field availability, user roles , or running replication recipes), complete the following steps: Correct the org configuration. Manually start the recipe through the Data Manager. Once the recipe completes, click Reset in the App. Do not change any of the options in the wizard, and complete the reset process. Upon completion of the reset, the app creation succeeds. Failure due to Data Sync When Data Sync is enabled for CRM Analytics, the creation of new Apps may fail during recipe execution due to the fact that objects or fields referenced in the apps have not yet been created successfully in a connected dataset via Data Sync. Failures can also occur when there is a new version of the CRM Analytics App that includes additional default fields. If your app fails due to data sync issues, complete the following steps: After the app failure, go to Data Manager > Connect, and run Data Sync for any SFDC Local connections. Open the App folder for the failed app and click the Reset button. Do not change any of the options in the wizard. Complete the reset process. Failure due to App Configuration The recipe can fail if a part of the configuration is incorrect. For example, the recipe could include a field reference whereas your Org contains custom references. Or, the recipe may require you have Forecasting enabled, and you do not have it enabled. To verify that this might be an issue review the Considerations section before enabling your app. If you can correct the issue by changing an answer or selection in the wizard, perform one of the following actions: Delete the App and create an entirely new version of the App. Reset the App and choose different answers, as appropriate."

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Considerations for Enabling and Disabling Customizable Product Schedules Insert or delete Apex triggers that you’ve applied to schedules are invoked immediately. Line Item Schedule is unavailable in Process Builder and Workflow. You can use custom fields and customize the layout in default product schedules, but if you’ve applied validation rules or Apex triggers, they’re bypassed when they’re first inserted. In addition, the layout of the OpportunityLineItemSchedule related list on the OpportunityLineItem page is customizable in Lightning Experience regardless of whether you’ve enabled customizable product schedules. If schedules are referenced in Apex, only one of the schedule types (quantity or revenue) can be disabled. For example, if Apex references the schedule object (represented as OpportunityLineItemSchedule in the code), one of the schedule types can be disabled, but not both. Considerations for Using Default Product Schedules If you add or change a product schedule, opportunities with that product aren’t updated. If a product has a default quantity schedule and a default revenue schedule, the quantity schedule is calculated first to determine the total product revenue. Then the revenue schedule is applied to that amount. If you have a quote line item with a discount, and the corresponding product record has a default schedule, you can’t edit the Discount field. If a product has default schedules established on the product record, the schedules are automatically created when you add the product to the opportunity. The dates of the installments begin with the date that you specified when adding the product. If you didn’t specify a product date, the installment dates begin with the opportunity Close Date. On default product schedules, we don’t support the type Repeat Amount for each installment for both quantity and revenue schedule types. You can set up repeat schedules for both quantity and revenue schedule types from the Schedules related list on an opportunity product record. In Lightning Experience, the Schedules related list on an opportunity product shows the default revenue schedule and the default quantity schedule as two separate items. In Salesforce Classic, the related list combines the schedules in a single item. When customizable product schedules are enabled, default field values and formulas aren’t supported by default product schedules. If amounts can’t be evenly divided when quantity or revenue schedules are enabled, the remaining amounts are placed into the final schedule period. Examples of Using Default Product Schedules Default Revenue Schedule Only: Your ASP company sells yearly contracts of product licenses at $1,200 per license. When a customer buys licenses, the licenses are all “delivered” at one time, but you recognize the revenue monthly. In this case, set a revenue schedule of Schedule Type=Divide, Installment Period=Monthly, and Number of Installments=12. With this default revenue schedule, a salesperson sells 200 licenses at a"

The total revenue for this product is the quantity of 200 multiplied by the unit price of $1,200 per year, for a total yearly revenue of $240,000. The revenue schedule divides the total revenue into monthly installments of $20,000 on the 15th of every month for the next year. Default Quantity Schedule Only: Your medical supplies company sells a box of tongue depressors for $10 per box. You normally have yearly contracts with hospitals to deliver boxes monthly. In this case, set a quantity schedule of Schedule Type=Repeat, Installment Period=Monthly, and Number of Installments=12.

The total revenue is calculated using the unit price and the total quantity. The total revenue of $1,040,000 is then divided into quarterly installments of $260,000."

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available with Sales Cloud and Government Cloud Plus for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions NOTE The Analytics Apps and Template functionality included as a part of CRM Analytics is available in English only. Requirements to Install Revenue Insights Enable data sync or direct data. Your org needs at least one record of each of these objects: Account, Opportunity, User, UserRole, Task, and Events. Role hierarchy must be set up with at least two layers. For example, you have one Sales Manager and one Sales Rep. Because Revenue Insights uses security predicates in its models, you must set it up from the Setup menu rather than Analytics Studio. This best practice ensures that all records in the dataset are used when training the models. Running setup from Analytics Studio can result in inaccurate or failed models NOTE Even if you use Territory hierarchy, you must have set up a role hierarchy. Requirements to Include Forecast Data Forecast data comes from Salesforce Forecasting, a feature of Sales Cloud. When you set up forecasting, you create and activate a forecast type. You must have an active forecast type that matches one of these types: OBJECT MEASURE* DATA TYPE HIERARCHY Opportunity Currency CloseDate (standard) Role hierarchy Opportunity Splits Currency CloseDate (standard) Role hierarchy Opportunity Currency CloseDate (standard) Territory hierarchy NOTE *Revenue Insights supports the standard Amount field or a custom field of type Currency. For a role hierarchy-based forecast, go to Setup > Forecast Hierarchy and assign forecast managers to at least two layers. For a territory hierarchy-based forecast, go to Setup > Sales > Territories > Territory Models and assign forecast managers to at least two layers. Go to Forecasts > Quota and load at least one quota value for your forecast type. If your forecast type is based on the Opportunity Splits object, you must have at least one Opportunity Split record. The measure you use in your forecast type must have historical trending enabled on the opportunity object. If you use an opportunity split, ensure that the associated rollup field on the opportunity object is trended. Requirements to Include Forecast and Quota Data Quota data comes from Salesforce Forecasting, a feature of Sales Cloud. Or, you can upload quota data from a CSV file, which allows you to use quota data stored outside of Salesforce. If you use Salesforce Forecasting, see the notes in Requirements to Add Forecast Data. To use a CSV file: Create a CSV file with your quota data and save it. Then, navigate to the CRMA Analytics Studio > quota dataset. Edit the dataset by uploading your CSV file, which replaces the default quota dataset. To ensure the recipe runs again and pulls in your quota data, refresh the app. Requirements and Considerations to use"

Opportunity stage durations are totaled differently in paths and reports. In paths, the stage duration is the number of days that the opportunity spends in a stage. In reports, the stage duration is the number of days from the time that the opportunity entered the stage to the time it’s moved to the next stage. EXAMPLE An opportunity is moved into the Proposal stage, stays there for 2 days, and then moves down the path into the Negotiation stage. Later, the opportunity is moved back into the Proposal stage and stays there for 3 days, where it currently remains.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with any Account Engagement Edition How It Works WARNING After you turn on Campaign Member Sync, we recommend that you keep it enabled at all times. The configuration affects other processes and can cause data discrepancies if it’s disabled later. Campaign Member Sync shows your prospects in Salesforce as campaign members. The sync works only from Account Engagement to Salesforce, so campaign member changes aren’t reflected in associated Account Engagement campaigns. Before you can use member sync, Connected Campaigns must be enabled. To sync a prospect, assign it to an Account Engagement user and associate it with an Account Engagement campaign. To indicate that a first touch came from an Account Engagement campaign, synced campaign members show a status of Connected. If a campaign member is missing or doesn’t show a Connected status, verify that the prerequisites for syncing have been met. The connector user or integration user has Edit permission on Campaigns. Marketing User is selected on its Salesforce user record. To add campaign members after the first touch, create a completion action. For more recent marketing engagement activity, view the prospect record. Other Considerations If the prospect shares an email address with another Salesforce contact, the record is synced as a contact. Otherwise, the prospect syncs as a lead. When you enable Campaign Member Sync, prospects sync retroactively for campaigns that are already connected. Campaign Member Sync doesn’t archive or delete lead or contact records from Salesforce. Remove associated records from Salesforce manually. The campaign member created date in Salesforce refers to when the prospect was synced, not the creation date in Account Engagement. Campaign Member Sync works alongside other prospect syncing jobs. Expect slower sync times when a connected campaign has more than 10,000 prospects."

In that case, if you give team members access to an individual opportunity, those users gain read-only access to accounts on the opportunity. Conversely, if you remove a user’s access to an individual account, the user is removed from opportunity teams related to the account. You can’t create opportunity teams for opportunities with the Private field selected. Ownership Changes When an opportunity is closed and the owner of the opportunity’s parent account changes, opportunity team shares are deleted unless opportunity splits are enabled. Portal Users High-volume portal users can’t be added to teams. SEE ALSO Administer Opportunity Teams Add Teams to Your Opportunities"

    "chunk_text": "Considerations for Enabling Multiple Currencies Enabling multiple currencies introduces permanent changes in your org. Before proceeding, be aware of these implications to ensure a smooth transition. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Group, Starter, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Developer, and Database.com Editions After you enable multiple currencies for your Salesforce org, you can’t disable it. If you enable multiple currencies, field-to-field filters in reports don't support currency fields, like amount. Upon enablement, existing records are stamped with a default currency code that you provide in your enablement request. For example, if your org contains records using USD and EUR, switch them all to the same default currency before enablement. Support for this type of conversion is also available as a Salesforce paid implementation service. Standard and custom objects, such as Account, Lead, Case, Opportunities, Opportunity Products, Opportunity Product Schedules, and Campaign Opportunities, have currency fields that support multiple currencies. Reports related to these objects and fields also support multiple currencies. By default, page layouts for these objects have multi-currency-compatible fields in which you can specify the currency for the record. Typically, these fields are available only when creating a record or editing an existing record. The selected currency is used for the primary amount field. When you create and test a package, the temporary build org has only USD configured. Using a currency code other than USD for testing results in an error After enablement, the number of decimal places defined in a custom currency field is ignored. Instead set decimal places per currency through Manage Currencies in Setup. After enablement, the primary currency displays as usual and, optionally, a secondary currency amount appears in parentheses. The primary currency is typically the default corporate currency, unless it’s overridden at the record level. The amount shown in parentheses is the user’s personal default currency, calculated based on the conversion rate settings defined in your org. To control whether the converted currency amount appears, enable or disable parenthetical currency conversion from the Manage Currencies page. In reports, the primary currency reflects either the default corporate currency or the currency selected for the record. The secondary currency reflects the personal default currency of the user running the report, or the currency specified in the report criteria. Users can specify a personal default currency on their personal information page. If parenthetical currency conversion is enabled, the personal default currency displays as the secondary currency amount (converted amount). Changing the personal default currency updates the converted amount in real time. After a currency is added to an org’s list of supported currencies, it can’t be deleted from the administrator’s list of currencies, even when it’s deactivated. The presence of inactive currencies in the administrator’s list is a cosmetic issue that doesn’t affect end users. A deactivated currency isn’t visible to end users, but remains visible to administrators. Salesforce recommends that you keep this issue in mind during testing and use only those currencies that you eventually plan to use in"

NOTE If you have only one currency in your multi-currency org, you can set a preference to display currency symbols instead of ISO codes. To display currency symbols, search Setup for User Interface, and then select Show currency symbols instead of ISO codes in the Currency Display Settings section of the User Interface settings page. If you later enable more currencies in your organization, ISO codes display, and this preference is no longer available. This preference applies only in the standard Salesforce user interface. By default, all converted amounts in your org rely on the current conversion rates defined for your org. Conversion rates must be set and updated manually. Changing the exchange rate automatically updates converted amounts on all records, including on closed opportunities. You can opt to use dated exchange rates by using advanced currency management to track historical exchange rates. Advanced currency management allows you to maintain a list of exchange rates by date range. Converted currency amounts on opportunities display based on the specified Close Date, regardless of the opportunity stage. If the Close Date changes to a different exchange rate period, changing the Close Date impacts converted amounts. NOTE Dated exchange rates aren’t used in forecasting, currency fields in other objects, or currency fields in other types of reports.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions In Sales Cloud, also available in: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions Quote PDFs don’t support right-to-left languages. The text aligns to the left side of the page. Text formatting isn’t available in the Text/Image Field for Unicode languages such as Arabic and Japanese.

Advanced Currency Management isn’t available with quotes. The maximum number of characters that you can use in the quotes template Text/Image Field is 32,000. This number includes the hidden HTML characters that are used to format text. Sometimes a field doesn’t appear on the quote templates palette or on a PDF that’s created from a template. If the default value for the field exceeds 255 characters, quote templates can’t include text areas or text fields. If a user can’t view or update a field because of field-level security settings, that field doesn’t appear on PDFs that are created from a template, even if the template includes that field. Read-only fields appear on PDFs. Fields that appear on a quote page layout but don’t contain data for a given quote appear on the quote templates palette but not when a PDF is created. Quote line item fields that don’t contain data don’t appear as columns in a list when a PDF is created, even if the template includes that field. For example, if no quote line items offer a discount, the Discount column doesn’t appear, even if the list includes the Discount field. If a related list isn’t included on a quote page layout, it doesn’t appear on the template palette or any PDFs for quotes that use that page layout. If the currency of a product on an opportunity differs from the user’s currency in a multicurrency org, currency fields for quotes and quote line items appear in both currencies. The product’s currency is converted to the user’s currency, and the converted amount appears in parentheses. Fields in quote custom reports appear in the report’s currency. Currency fields include Subtotal, Tax, and Grand Total. If you create a Developer or Developer Pro sandbox, templates that contain Text/Image fields can’t be opened for editing within the sandbox. Fields within sections have different alignment than columns within lists, so if you place a totals section below a list, its field values won’t align directly below the right-hand list values. For example, say your template includes a list of quote line items, including a Total Price column at the far right that shows the total for each line item. If you add a totals section beneath the list, and you include Subtotal, Total Price, and Grand Total fields, their values will show the total of all line items, but the amounts"

In Lightning Experience, customize schedules with custom fields, custom buttons, customized layout, validation rules, and Apex triggers. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions A quantity schedule determines when a product is delivered. A revenue schedule determines when a product is paid for. A default schedule is associated with a specific product in a specific price book. Every time the product is added to an opportunity, the default schedule is used. You can override the default schedules on any opportunity. You determine which types of schedules your reps can use and which types of schedules can be established for each individual product. A quantity schedule is suitable if your customers pay once but receive the product in increments, for example, as with an annual magazine subscription for a monthly magazine. A quantity schedule defines the dates, number of units, and number of installments for payments, shipping, or other use as determined by your company. A revenue schedule is suitable if your customers make regular payments but receive the product once, for example, if you sell customized products that are charged in installments but delivered once. A revenue schedule defines the dates, revenue amounts, and number of installments for payments, recognizing revenue, or other use. A revenue and quantity schedule is suitable if your customers receive their orders on a delivery schedule and pay for the products using a payment schedule, for example, a monthly product subscription that’s paid for monthly. A default schedule is suitable if all your customers make product payments on the same timetable or you deliver products on a regular schedule. If you typically customize schedules, there’s no advantage to creating default schedules. When you enable customizable product schedules, the Salesforce Classic actions on product schedules are disabled, and Line Item Schedule is added to the object manager. In Salesforce Classic, product schedules become read-only. Enable Product Schedules in Salesforce Classic Create default revenue and quantity schedules for products that are delivered or paid for over time.

Account Owner Changes and Group-Based Access Suppose that a user with group-based access adds account team members. If the account owner is changed, the team members added by users with group-based access are removed from the team, even if the Keep account team option is selected. To keep the team members related to the account, they should be added by a Salesforce admin, the account owner, or someone above the owner in the role hierarchy.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: All Account Engagement Editions with Salesforce Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Before You Start Create an equivalent Salesforce campaign for each Account Engagement campaign, including the default Account Engagement campaigns Website Tracking, Email Plug-In, and Salesforce Sync. Organize and dedupe existing Account Engagement campaigns. Create the Salesforce record types that you plan to use when syncing campaigns. Requirements Connected Campaigns requires a verified Salesforce connector, a Salesforce login, and an admin to enable the feature. For the best experience, don’t turn off Connected Campaigns after you turn it on. About Record Types IMPORTANT Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. We maintained certain terms to avoid any effect on customer implementations. To limit which counterpart campaigns are created in Account Engagement, use record types with Connected Campaigns. In the Connected Campaigns settings, you can deselect record types, if they aren’t needed. For best performance, use record types to sync only the campaigns that you expect to connect frequently. It takes time to load all the campaigns in the menu that you use to connect Salesforce campaigns—the fewer campaigns to choose from, the better. The Master record type is the default record type for new records. To avoid syncing unnecessary Salesforce campaigns, we recommend that you don’t choose this record type. Work with your Salesforce admin to create alternate record types. To connect more than one Account Engagement business unit to a single Salesforce org, create different campaign record types for each business unit. After You Connect Campaigns Salesforce copies marketing forms, marketing links, and list emails from Account Engagement campaigns to their connected Salesforce campaigns. This data counts against your company’s data storage limits. The Account Engagement campaign record becomes read-only, so always create campaigns from the Campaigns tab in Salesforce. When campaigns are connected, Salesforce replaces the values of these Account Engagement campaign fields, which can’t be undone. Name Archive Date (maps to End Date on Salesforce campaigns) Cost Created By Updated By Updated At Some actions associated with Account Engagement campaigns are removed. The Add Campaign and Connect to CRM Campaign actions no longer appear on the Account Engagement Campaigns tab, and the Account Engagement Campaigns recycling bin is no longer available. You can use only active campaigns in automations and completion actions. NOTE To support Account Engagement features available within Sales Cloud, Salesforce added a user called B2BMA Integration User to all Salesforce customers who also have Account Engagement. This new user is read-only, doesn’t affect your Salesforce license usage, and can’t access or update data by default. If you choose to opt in to the new Account Engagement features available in Sales Cloud, this user enables campaign and engagement data to be shared and copied between the two systems.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions A price book is a list of products and their prices. The standard price book is the master list of all your products and their default standard prices. Salesforce creates the standard price book when you start creating product records. It includes all your products and their standard prices regardless of any custom price books that include those products. A custom price book is a separate list of products with custom prices, called list prices. Custom price books are ideal for offering products at different prices to different market segments, regions, or other subsets of your customers. Create a separate price book for each set of customers that you want to address. For example, if you have one set of prices for domestic customers and another for international customers, create a domestic price book and an international one. A price book entry is a product with its price as listed in a price book. Each price book entry specifies a currency for the price. Standard price book entries are the default (standard) prices for the products and services in the standard price book. When you create a product record, Salesforce creates a standard price book entry. You can mark the standard price book entry as active or inactive, depending, for example, on whether you intend to start selling the product right away. Custom price book entries are the custom (list) prices for the products and services in your custom price books. Custom price book entries can be created only for products with active standard price book entries. In Lightning Experience, Product detail pages display the Standard Price related list and the Price Books related list as a single Price Books related list. If you customize the Price Book Entry detail page layout, no field dependencies exist for price book entry fields in the user interface. If the Use Standard Price checkbox is removed from the page layout, and this checkbox is selected for a price book entry, you can’t edit the list price. The List Price field is disabled and can’t be enabled on this page. Create Custom Price Books Create custom price books for each market segment that your sales reps sell to. Then add products to each price book with the prices that you offer each market segment. For example, if you sell to domestic and international customers at different prices, you can create two custom price books: a domestic one and an international one. Considerations for Creating and Maintaining Price Books Before you create a price book, consider a few key points. Guidelines for Sharing Price Books Extend access to price books to more of your sales team members through sharing in Salesforce Classic.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Available with Revenue Intelligence, which is available for an additional cost in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions Pipeline Inspection Metrics Users can choose from two groups of metrics in Pipeline Inspection to view their pipelines. The metrics groups are based on forecast categories or pipeline changes. Number values for the metrics are shown in the user’s currency. Forecast category metrics are configurable as single or multiple category rollups. For summarizing metrics, Pipeline Inspection supports the Amount field, and custom currency and number fields. Formula fields can’t be used as summary fields. Forecast Category Metrics Group The Forecast Category metrics show how your pipeline metrics map to the forecast categories in your company’s sales cycle. NOTE When multiple category rollups are enabled and the Most Likely category is set up, Most Likely is included in Best Case, Most Likely, Pipeline, and Total. METRIC REPRESENTS THE TOTAL FOR OPPORTUNITIES Best Case With forecast categories of Closed, Commit, Best Case, or Most Likely (optional). Closed Lost In a stage classified as Closed/Lost. Closed Won In a stage classified as Closed/Won. Commit With forecast categories of Closed or Commit. Most Likely With forecast categories of Closed, Commit, and Most Likely (optional). Pipeline With forecast categories of Best Case, Commit, Most Likely (optional), or Pipeline. Total With forecast categories of Closed, Commit, Best Case, Most Likely (optional), or Pipeline. Opportunities with a Forecast Category of Omitted are excluded from the forecast. Pipeline Changes Metrics Group The Pipeline Changes metrics show how your pipeline changes over time. The Close Date filter shows opportunities based on their scheduled close date for the time period you specified. The Changes Since filter defines the time period in which changes for these opportunities occurred. For example, a common snapshot a sales manager looks at is, “For my team’s opportunities with close dates in this quarter, what changes took place between the first day of the quarter and today?” To create a snapshot, pipeline metrics are compared over the two dates. To see this snapshot, select these filters: Close Date: This Quarter Owner: My Team Changes Since: Start of the Period To validate the change metrics, you can use one of these options: field history tracking, historical trend reporting, or opportunity stage history. From any of these sources, get the field values on the first day of the period and compare them to the current value. EXAMPLE On the first day of the quarter, Bill has a $100,000 deal with Acme Co. with a close date in next quarter. As of today, the close date on the Acme deal is in this quarter and the deal is Closed Won. In the Pipeline Changes view, the metrics show $100,000 in"

Salesforce makes the best attempt to accurately associate the contact with the right account. While we can’t guarantee it’s always accurate, these rules promote correct associations. Salesforce checks whether any account has contacts with the same email domain as the new contact. The account that has the most contacts with the same email domain as the new contact is selected. If the first rule doesn’t associate an account to the new contact, Salesforce selects the account with the most related contacts from the group of contacts.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Custom Fields and Picklists Custom fields and picklists aren't visible in Salesforce Classic. You can create up to 100 custom fields for an account team. When editing team members, users see custom fields, even if you don’t add the fields to the Add Account Team Members multiline page layout. If you delete a custom field, filters based on the custom field are also deleted. The results of assignment or escalation rules that rely on the custom field’s data can change. If you include a default value for a custom field, the field appears blank to Lightning Experience users while they’re adding account team members. If users don’t enter a value, the default value appears on the record after they save. Mass Reassign Account Teams doesn’t support custom picklists. Team Member Information You can’t create a lookup from an object, such as an account, to an account team member. The Account Team related list is sorted by Team Member Name. The sort order can’t be customized, even if you specify the sort order in the Account Team Member page layout. A user can sort the related list by any other column, but when the page is refreshed, sorting reverts to the Team Member Name column. If you set the organization-wide default for contacts to Controlled by Parent, users can’t see or edit the Contact Access field. Only users with the Modify All Data profile permission can grant account team members higher access levels than the access levels of the account owner. In Lightning Experience, the running user’s permissions determine the available access level picklist values. In Salesforce Classic, an exception prevents users without the Modify All Data profile permission from saving higher access levels. When accounts are merged, account team members are deleted if they were added by a user who did not have sharing access on the account record. A deleted account team member record isn’t moved to the Recycle Bin. It can’t be recovered unless the record was cascade-deleted when deleting a related account. For more information, see AccountTeamMember in the Object Reference. Account team member records don’t support overriding the behavior of standard buttons—like Edit or Delete—with Visualforce pages. Validation Rules, Flows, and Apex Trigger Support Validation rules, flows, and Apex triggers are applied when Lightning Experience users add their default team to an account using the Add action on the related list. However, they’re not applied when Lightning Experience users select the personal settings option to add their default team to accounts automatically. Validation rules and Apex triggers are bypassed when Salesforce Classic users add default account teams via any method. When an account team member is removed during an account ownership change, Apex triggers are bypassed. SEE ALSO Customize Account Team Roles"

Add Customizable Campaign Influence data in related lists and reports so that your reps can understand which campaigns impact their opportunity pipeline. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Influence models scan active campaigns to identify members who are also assigned a contact role on an open opportunity. A model creates a campaign influence record based on that relationship. Influence can be assigned manually on an opportunity record or automatically via Apex triggers or the API. After an opportunity’s stage is closed (won or lost), influence records are no longer created. Campaign Influence considers every campaign member, regardless of their member status. The Customizable Campaign Influence models rely on the Campaign object, the Opportunity object, and a Campaign Influence junction object. When you enable Customizable Campaign Influence, the standard objects CampaignInfluence and CampaignInfluenceModel are added to your org. You can build a report or dashboard for any active influence model. Access to Campaign Influence Records Campaign influence records are exposed to users through related lists and reports. A related list shows data from one model at a time. Choose which model you want to use, and set it as the default. To allow users to add or edit campaign influence records from opportunity records, the default model must be custom and unlocked. NOTE In Salesforce Classic, the Influenced Opportunities related list displays an opportunity only if the influence is more than 0%. In Lightning Experience, opportunity records display regardless of influence percentage. Standard vs. Custom Models The Primary Campaign Source model is the default model that comes with Customizable Campaign Influence. It assigns 100% influence to the campaign noted in the Primary Campaign Source field on an opportunity. It uses auto-association, which means users can’t add campaign influence records to the model manually. Influence records created by the Primary Campaign Source model are recalculated when one of these events occurs. Any Customizable Campaign Influence setting is changed An opportunity’s Close Date is changed A member is added or removed from a campaign An account or opportunity is deleted or undeleted If the Primary Campaign Source model doesn’t meet your business needs, you can create custom models. With a custom model, users manually add or edit an influence percentage in the Campaign Influence related list on an opportunity record. Custom model settings are unlocked by default, so that users can update records themselves. When a custom model is locked, it accepts updates via API only. NOTE Opportunities added by the primary source campaign field appear in Campaign Statistics only when the Primary Source Campaign model is set as the default. If you’re using another model, the value shows opportunities added by auto-association only. The number of custom models you can create varies by your edition.

    "chunk_text": "Territory Forecasts If your sales team uses Sales Territories, Salesforce Forecasting, and Lightning Experience, they can forecast by territory. Territory forecasts give your team a snapshot of how expected sales compare between territories. Want to know which territory has the most closed deals this month? Or which territory is lagging in software deals? Use territory forecasts to find out. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Developer and Performance Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud When territory forecasts are enabled, the forecasts page shows the user the following. Forecast rollups based on the territories assigned to each opportunity Forecasts for the territories that the user is assigned to Territory forecasts shared to the user The opportunities included in territory forecasts, regardless of whether the opportunity owner is assigned to the territory Users can also drill down to: Child territories’ forecasts. An individual rep’s forecasts for a territory if the territory doesn’t have a forecast manager. Territory forecasts are based on your territory hierarchy, not your user role hierarchy, as other forecast types are. Users switch from role-based forecasts to territory-based forecasts by selecting a territory forecast type as a tab on the forecasts page. In territory forecasts, an opportunity is rolled up into one territory forecast only. If you use opportunity splits in a team selling scenario, each split on the opportunity only rolls up to one territory. WARNING Deleting or archiving a territory model deletes the related forecast data. We recommend running the opportunity territory assignment filter and taking screenshots of the forecasts page. You can also export forecasting data, or create a snapshot before deleting or archiving a territory model. When you activate another territory model, you must add a territory forecast type for it. Who Sees What in Territory Forecasts A territory’s forecast manager can view the forecasts for that territory. If the territory has other users assigned, those users can’t view that territory’s forecasts. Those users’ opportunities are rolled up into the territory’s forecasts and aren’t grouped by user. If a forecast manager is assigned, the territory’s opportunities roll up into the territory forecast, not the individual users’ forecasts. If no forecast manager is assigned, the opportunities are grouped based on the individual users within the territory. A “holdout” scenario occurs when a user owns an opportunity that’s assigned to a territory but the user isn’t assigned to the territory. For example, you own the Smith & Co. opportunity, and it’s assigned to your California territory, but you’re not assigned to the California territory. In this scenario, the opportunity list includes the opportunity, and the user appears in the forecasts grid but isn’t searchable. Forecast managers can share their forecasts with any Salesforce user at their company. When sharing, they specify whether a coworker can make adjustments or only view the shared forecasts. Forecast managers can’t share their summary view. Forecast users can see all their territory forecasts in the single-page summary view. The view shows forecasts for the top-level"

Mexico (Kim) US (Dan) CA (Amy) LA (Kim) SAC (Amy) SF (Dan) With your territory hierarchy set up this way: Amy sees forecasts for Canada and CA. Dan sees forecasts for Quebec and US. Kim sees forecasts for Quebec, Mexico, and LA. Then Amy and Dan can drill down to child territory forecasts. For example, Amy can get forecasts for Ontario and SAC. For Kim, no child territory forecasts are available. SEE ALSO Sales Territories Concepts Considerations for Managing Territory Pipeline Forecasts"

Rollup Methods for Pipeline Forecasts Learn about methods for rolling up opportunities into forecasts for your sales teams. Show, Hide, and Reorder Pipeline Forecast Columns Customize the display of most standard and custom forecast columns on the forecasts page. For example, you can position a custom Most Likely column to appear next to the Open Pipeline column. Include Other Data in Custom Columns in Pipeline Forecasts Make forecast decisions using all the data that matters to your business by adding custom columns to a forecast. Custom columns can show data that’s imported and referenced, such as Stretch Quota or Internal Booking Target, or a calculated value, such as gap to quota. Having all the information in one place helps you create more precise forecasts without having to turn to other resources. Manage Opportunity Stage to Forecast Category Mappings for Pipeline Forecasts Forecasts rely on how picklist values map between the Stage field and the Forecast Category field on opportunities. For example, if you map the Negotiation/Review stage to the Best Case forecast category, the amounts of your opportunities in Negotiation/Review are included in your Best Case forecast amount. If the stage of an opportunity changes, the probability and forecast category also change. Customize Pipeline Forecast Categories A forecast category is the category within the sales cycle to which an opportunity is assigned based on its opportunity stage. The standard forecast categories are Pipeline, Best Case, Commit, Omitted (not included in forecasts), and Closed. Salesforce admins can add a Most Likely category in Lightning Experience and rename categories in both single category rollups and cumulative category rollup scenarios. Allow Point-in-Time Pipeline Forecast Submissions Forecast submissions are sales reps’ or managers’ best estimates of the revenue or quantities they expect to close during the forecast period. As management levels within the sales organization review forecast rollups, they compare the current forecast against the submitted forecast numbers and quota.

Account fields exclusive to person accounts, such as Birthdate, Email, and Title have “Account.Person” in their merge field names. For example, {!Account.PersonBirthdate}. You can use the merge field {!Account.IsPersonAccount} to determine whether you are working with a person account or a business account. Account fields that previously had unique names and labels are no longer unique because some contact fields are displayed as part of the account object. Look for the person account icon () to identify these fields. Ensure that all custom account fields have field names and labels unique to your organization so that the merge field references the correct field. IMPORTANT If two or more custom objects have matching names or labels, only one of the objects appears when you select from available merge fields. Make sure that all custom objects have unique names and labels so that you can select merge fields from any of the objects.

    "chunk_text": "Forecast Period Row Generation in Salesforce Forecasting Review how forecast period rows are generated based on fiscal year, default settings, and forecastable items per user. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: All editions with Sales Cloud When forecasting is enabled, for each fiscal year that includes forecastable items, 17 period rows are generated, with 1 row for: Each month of the year (12 rows total) Each quarter of the year (4 rows total) For the entire year (1 row total) The default date range and forecastable items for a user determine which fiscal years forecast periods are generated for. Default Date Range The date range that’s set in the Choose a Default Date Range section of the Forecast Settings page specifies which forecast periods are shown by default on the forecasts page. To make sure that all forecast periods within the specified range are available, forecast periods are generated for each fiscal year in the maximum range. Each Forecast User Period rows are generated between the earliest fiscal year that a user has a forecastable item and the latest fiscal year, up to 10 years in the future from the current period. In some cases forecast period rows are generated for only the year that a forecastable item is created in. A forecastable item is created beyond the current range of forecast periods available. For example, if your current periods go out to 2028, and you create a forecastable item in 2030, period rows are created for 2030, but not for 2029. If the dimensions for your forecast change, such as a user changes roles in the hierarchy or your fiscal year changes, periods for the user are recalculated and the periods for year 2029 are generated at the time. A forecastable item is created in the past. For example, if you have preexisting periods from 2020 to 2025, and you create a forecastable item in 2017, forecast periods for the fiscal year 2017 are created, but not for 2018 and 2019. A change in forecasting dimensions doesn’t create periods for 2018 and 2019 in this case."

Select the folder in which your Salesforce admin has placed the forecasting report types. For example, many admins store Forecasting Items and Forecasting Quotas reports in a Forecasts folder. If you don’t see the fields or report type names described in this table, check with your admin. If a report that uses a specific forecast type doesn’t run, that forecast type was likely deleted. Check with your admin. Reports contain the latest information at the time when you run the report. If changes are in progress while the report is running, you can see a difference between your reports and the forecasts page. The data available to you in a report depends on what you have access to and can view in Salesforce Forecasting.

For details about timing and eligibility, contact your Salesforce account executive. Opportunity scores are available in both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience, but you have to turn on Einstein in Lightning Experience. When you don’t have any Sales Cloud Einstein licenses, Einstein Opportunity Scoring isn’t available in sandbox or for Salesforce Government Cloud customers. If you’re missing the option to enable Einstein Opportunity Scoring, contact Salesforce Customer Support. To get started with Einstein, follow the in-app prompts. Or, from Setup in Lightning Experience, enter Assisted Setup in the Quick Find. Then, select Assisted Setup under Einstein Sales. Confirm that you understand what happens when you turn on Einstein. Click Turn It On. If needed, review and accept the terms. Here’s what happens next. We analyze your teams’ past opportunities to build a scoring model. Building a model can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on how much data you have. The model, which is refreshed at regular intervals, is used to generate scores. We add the Score field to your standard and custom opportunity page layouts. If you use full view as your default record view, scores don’t always appear in the layout’s first section. We add the Opportunity Score field to the Recently Viewed list view. Add the field to public opportunity list views and ask your sales teams to add it to their own opportunity list views. We assign the Sales Cloud Einstein For Everyone permission set to all users who have a Salesforce user license. Users see scores after they’re generated. You can remove access for individual users through the permission set. We create a Sales Insights Integration user and assign it to a user profile of the same name. Although you see the user and profile listed in your org, they’re used only behind the scenes. TIP If you don’t see scores a few days after turning on Einstein, review information about how Einstein scores your opportunities. If you still need help, contact Salesforce Customer Support for assistance. To customize the scoring model, go to the Einstein Opportunity Scoring setup page and click Review Settings.

Pipeline Forecasting Best Practices Review key guidelines to get the most out of your opportunity-based forecasts. Managing Pipeline Forecasts Get an all-in-one view and place to manage your sales team’s expected revenue in the Forecasts tab. Pipeline Forecasting Charts Use built-in charts to visualize the state of your forecasts and better assist sales reps in meeting their sales targets. With forecast charts, see the changes to the current period’s forecasts across forecast types and measure how this period’s forecasts compares to past periods, without having to manually crunch the numbers. Adjustments in Pipeline Forecasts A forecast adjustment indicates an assessment about the sales value that a forecast manager or sales rep feels confident of closing during of the forecast period. Adjusting Best Case and Commit forecasts values is a way to accurately gauge where a sales team is on their path to hitting its sales numbers. An adjustment doesn’t change the underlying gross rollup and doesn’t appear in reports. It just adds a layer of detail to a forecast. Manager Judgments in Pipeline Forecasts As a forecast manager, you assess your forecasts during each period and adjust the forecast as you receive new information and circumstances change. To create the most accurate forecast possible, apply your judgment about whether you consider an opportunity part of the forecast total. Applying your judgment as a forecast manager provides visibility into which deals you have the highest confidence to close and a more accurate picture of your forecast to managers above you in the hierarchy. Capturing Pipeline Forecasts at a Point in Time Forecast submissions are your best estimate of the revenue or quantities that you expect to close during the forecast period. Typically required weekly, the submission takes a snapshot of your forecast at the time you make the submission. As management levels review forecast rollups, they compare the current forecast against the submitted forecast numbers and quota, and know that the forecast is up to date. Any differences better inform the forecast for the entire sales team and the business."

We wish we could snap our fingers to update the name everywhere, but you can expect to see the previous name in a few places until we replace it, including in the app itself. Before you enable the feature or begin connecting campaigns, we recommend that you outline how your campaigns relate to each other. Consider the following tasks. For best results, make sure that every campaign you want to use has a counterpart. Identify the Account Engagement campaigns that you want to keep. Do their equivalent Salesforce campaigns exist? Identify the Salesforce campaigns that you want to keep. Do their equivalent Account Engagement campaigns exist? Identify which Account Engagement campaigns, if any, must stay in Account Engagement only. Create record types or assignments to organize your campaigns. When the preparation is complete, head over to Account Engagement Settings and get started with Connected Campaigns. NOTE The B2BMA Integration user doesn’t need the Account Engagement Marketing User role to enable and work with Connected Campaigns. Make sure that you create counterpart campaigns in Salesforce for Account Engagement default and required campaigns, including Website Tracking and Salesforce Sync. If you aren’t using the Email Plug-in campaign, delete it before you connect. A Account Engagement campaign is updated or created each time the Salesforce campaign is edited by a person or process. To limit the number of campaigns created in Account Engagement, identify a cut-off date for replication. Open the Connected Campaigns page. In Account Engagement, open Settings and click Edit. Scroll to Connected Campaigns. In the Lightning app, select Account Engagement Settings and then Connectors. Click the gear icon to edit the Salesforce connector, and select the Campaigns tab. Select Enable Connected Campaigns and Engagement History. Select the Salesforce campaign record types that can be connected. Save your work. The previous steps prepare your org for the alignment stage of setup. Unconnected campaigns continue to show in both places. Now, your marketing team can connect campaigns individually or in bulk. After they’re done, complete the setup process by giving Salesforce access to manage the campaigns. On the same connector settings page, select Use Salesforce to manage all campaigns. To reduce the number of campaigns that are replicated over time, enter a date under Limit Campaign Creation by Date. To let Account Engagement users continue to see the remaining unconnected campaigns, select Show Unconnected Campaigns. Users now manage campaigns only in Salesforce.

The chart includes key metrics and a visual representation of changes as the period has progressed. The information that’s available to you in the chart depends on enabled features and how long forecast data is retained. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions To review charts for a forecast, toggle to the Chart view on the forecasts page. You have access to charts for your forecasts across all forecast types and any of your subordinates. Here’s a Weekly Changes chart example where quota and cumulative category rollups are enabled. Depending on your system setup, your chart can look different. Metrics indicate key information as of today. Each metric also includes the percent change from the same time last week. METRIC DESCRIPTION Target Commit compared to quota. If the commit value is greater than quota, the user is on target to meet or exceed their quota for the period. Commit Total commit value. In cumulative category rollups, this value includes opportunities in the Commit and Closed forecast categories. Gap to Quota Quota minus Closed Won, which indicates how much is needed to meet quota. Closed Won Total value of opportunities that have been won and are now closed. Pipe Coverage Open pipeline divided by quota. If quota data isn’t available, the metrics that require quota aren’t shown. If Einstein Forecasting is enabled and its data requirements are met, additional AI-generated metrics about forecast predictions are shown. Bar Chart Segments Each time segment shows opportunities grouped by their forecast category. If you use single category rollups, open pipeline is represented as a bar segment. For cumulative category rollups, the open pipeline is shown as a dot on the chart. Hover over each segment for details about the changes compared to the previous week. METRIC DESCRIPTION Forecast Amount The total forecast for the category including any adjustments made. The weekly and monthly changes including adjustments are included below the value. This value is shown when viewing the chart with adjustments. Amount Without Adjustments The total forecast for the category without adjustments. The weekly and monthly changes without adjustments are indicated below this value. This value is shown when viewing the chart without adjustments. Weekly Change and Weekly Percent The percentage difference compared to the same time last week. For example, if you’re viewing changes 2 days from the end of the week, the comparison is made to when there were 2 days from the end of last week. Monthly Change The percentage difference compared to the same time last month, based on time remaining in the month. For example, if there are currently 20 days remaining in the current month, the comparison is made to the day when there were 20 days remaining in the previous month. For example, July has 31 days, while June has 30. Therefore, July 11 is compared to June 10. If Einstein Forecasting is enabled"

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions You can’t restrict access to contacts beyond your organization’s default access levels. You need at least read access to the contacts and leads that you invite to an event. You need at least “Add Events” on a resource to invite it to an event. A contact that isn’t linked to an account is always private, regardless of your organization’s sharing model. Only the owner of the contact and administrators can view it. Sharing rules and workflow rules don’t apply to private contacts. If your organization uses divisions, private contacts always belong to the global division. If a recipient doesn’t have access to the account, you can’t share the contact unless you also have permission to share the account. If your organization-wide default for contacts is set to Controlled by Parent, the Contact Access options aren’t available when you share related records such as accounts. Instead, all access to contacts is determined by the user’s access to the contact’s account. If your organization-wide default for contacts is Controlled by Parent and your organization-wide default for accounts is Private, you can’t view contacts for accounts that you don’t own, even if you have the View All Records permission on the account object. However, if you own a contact on an account, you can view other contacts on the same account. (Access to a parent account gives you access to the associated child records.) SEE ALSO Share Contacts"

    "chunk_text": "Considerations for Managing Territory Assignments for Splits Review important considerations before setting up and configuring the capability for sales teams to assign opportunity splits and opportunity product splits to territories. Opportunity Splits are available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic Opportunity Product Splits are available in Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Sales Cloud Setup When you turn on View all opportunities associated with the territory’s child territory, regardless of who owns the opportunity, users in a parent territory have access to the opportunity when the territory is specified on the opportunity split or opportunity product split. When you turn on Use the opportunity’s territory as the default split territory when the default revenue type split is created for the opportunity owner, anytime the default opportunity owner split is created for a revenue type, that split inherits the territory of the parent opportunity. If you use an Apex script to auto-create splits for team members on opportunities, check your script to determine whether you need to update it before you turn on this setting. For example, if your Apex code is written to insert team member revenue type splits with nonzero percentages, your code can fail for opportunities with assigned territories. The reason is that when a team member revenue type split is inserted with a nonzero percentage, we take that percentage from an opportunity owner split in the same territory. If a split doesn’t exist in the same territory for the opportunity owner, the insert of the team member split fails. Update your Apex logic to account for this new behavior by inserting the team member split with the same territory as the territory associated with the default opportunity owner split. First, insert the team member's split at 0%. Then do a bulk update of that split and the opportunity owner's split to update all splits to the percentages that you want. Territory Models and Territories When you archive a territory model, users without the ManageTerritories permission can’t access the territories in that model. Split records retain the association with the territories in an archived territory model. While this association doesn’t cause errors, we recommend reassigning the records to territories in an active territory model. You can't delete territory models that have territories with associated opportunity splits or opportunity product splits. Remove the territory associations before you delete the territory models, or reassign the splits to other active territories. To delete an archived territory model, remove the territory associations or reassign the splits to a territory in an active territory model. You can reassign split records to different territories several ways. Use the filter-based opportunity territory assignment tool that’s available in Territory Settings in Setup (recommended). Users can manually reassign the territories. Use Data Loader to import updated records. Fields and Reports The default field label in the multi-line layout on the opportunity split and opportunity product split object is Territory. To see reports of splits by territory, use the Split"

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic for some features and Lightning Experience for all features Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud Planning and Managing Territories Establish territory models that give your sales teams the best coverage. Design models on a map by using Territory Planning, available as an add-on product. Then put your models into action by using Sales Territories. Continuous model optimizations help your company make the most of staffing, leadership, and economic changes. Territory Type Territory types help you organize your territories by key characteristics important to your company. Every territory you create has a territory type. Territory types are used for organizing and creating territories only. They don’t appear on territory model hierarchies. Territory Type Priority Specifying and managing territory type priority information helps you choose the appropriate territory type for territories you create or edit. You create your own priority scheme. For example, 001 can indicate that a territory type is the highest priority or the lowest. Make sure that your scheme can scale as you add more territory types. Territory Territories organize groups of accounts, leads, and the Salesforce users who work with them. Territories are created based on territory types. Territory Model A territory model represents a complete territory management system for your company. Modeling lets you create and preview multiple territory structures and different account, lead, and user assignments before you activate the model that works best. Territory Hierarchy The territory hierarchy shows a model’s territory structure and serves as its main interaction point. Start from the hierarchy to create, edit, and delete territories; run assignment rules for territories, and navigate to territory detail pages for more information. From the hierarchy, you can also assign territories to opportunities, run assignment rules at the model level, and activate or archive the model. The forecasts hierarchy for territory forecasts is based on your territory hierarchy in the active territory model. Territory Model State Territory model state indicates whether a territory is in the planning stage, in active use, or archived. You can have only one active territory model at a time. But you can create and maintain multiple models in planning or archived state to use for extra modeling or reference. Some states reflect a territory model’s lifecycle and others indicate errors in processing when states are changed. How Do Permissions for Territories Affect Feature and Data Access?

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Starter, Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Pro Suite, and Developer Editions with Sales Cloud When you convert qualified leads, Salesforce moves any campaign members to the new contacts. The leads become read-only records, unless your administrator gives you permission to edit them. Salesforce attaches all activities from the converted lead to the resulting account, contact, and opportunity, except activities initiated from a Sales Engagement cadence. If you delete one of these activities from any of the resulting records, Salesforce also removes it from the other records. To restore an activity to all resulting records, remove it from the recycle bin. You can assign the owners of these new records, and schedule follow-up tasks. When you assign new owners, only the open activities are assigned to the new owner. If you have custom lead fields, that information can be inserted into custom account, contact, or opportunity fields. Your admin can also set up your custom lead fields to populate custom account, contact, and opportunity fields automatically. You can’t view converted leads, unless your admin has assigned you the View and Edit Converted Leads permission. However, converted leads do appear in lead reports. Salesforce updates the Last Modified Date and Last Modified By system fields on converted leads when picklist values included on converted leads are changed. Apex Triggers During lead conversion, triggers fire. Universally required custom fields and validation rules are enforced. When updating a lead, triggers that cause the lead to convert can cause a warning. The warning indicates that the lead is no longer accessible to the user because it’s been converted to a contact. Refer to the new contact instead. If the Require Validation for Converted Leads checkbox on the Lead Settings page is deselected, Salesforce ignores lookup filters when converting leads. Converting leads with many associated events and tasks, or converting leads to accounts or contacts, can result in Apex governor limit errors, especially if there are triggers on the objects. See Apex Governor Limits. Campaigns A lead can match an existing contact. If both records are linked to the same campaign, the campaign member status is determined by whichever is further along in the campaign lifecycle. For example, if the lead member status is “sent” and the contact member status is “responded”, the responded value is applied to the contact. Related campaign information is always associated with the new contact record, regardless of the user's sharing access to the campaign. When more than one campaign is associated with a lead, the most recently associated campaign is applied to the Primary Campaign Source field for the opportunity, regardless of the user's sharing access to the campaign.

Contacts to Multiple Accounts If your organization uses Contacts to Multiple Accounts, when you convert a lead to an existing contact, Salesforce creates a relationship record that connects the contact to the lead’s account. Divisions The new account, contact, and opportunity are assigned to the same division as the lead. If you update an existing account during lead conversion, the account’s division isn’t changed, and the new contact and opportunity inherit the account’s division. Duplicate Management When you convert leads to contacts or accounts, the process sometimes creates duplicate records. If so, we show you a warning. Custom warnings set up by your administrator don’t appear during lead conversion. When you begin to convert a lead, possible matches appear based on matching rules using standard fields. When you click Convert, additional matches can appear based on matching rules using custom fields. How these duplicate records are handled depends on how your Salesforce admin has set up Apex Lead Convert and Duplicate Management. For example, your administrator can require that you resolve the duplicates before you finish converting. If your admin has created any cross-object duplicate rules, they aren't triggered during lead conversion. Enterprise Territory Management Filter-based opportunity territory assignment isn’t triggered when an opportunity is created through lead conversion. Existing Accounts and Contacts When updating existing accounts or contacts during lead conversion, the values of mapped lead fields don’t overwrite the values of the mapped account and contact fields. If existing accounts and contacts share the names specified on the leads, you can choose to update the existing accounts and contacts. Salesforce adds information from the lead into empty fields on the contact and account. Salesforce doesn’t overwrite existing account and contact data with any lead data. For the composite address field, which is made up of several individual fields, Salesforce only adds information to empty individual fields on the contact and account. When the State and Country/Territory picklists are enabled, the State/Province and Country fields on the lead only transfer to the existing contact when both the State/Province and Country fields on the contact aren't set. Be sure to verify the resulting data on the contact and account after lead conversion. Health Cloud The fields Specialty and Birth Date are available for use only in Health Cloud. They don’t map to any fields when you convert a lead because they don’t have equivalents on an account, contact, or opportunity. List Emails When a lead converts, list email activities associated with the lead become associated with the contact but aren’t associated with the resulting opportunity. Local Lead Names Company Name (Local) on the lead automatically maps to Account Name (Local), along with their associated standard name fields. New Accounts and Contacts When new accounts or contacts are created during lead conversion, the values of mapped lead fields overwrite the default values of the mapped account and contact fields.

    "chunk_text": "added to the Opportunity Contact Role object, users can't create opportunities during lead conversion. Because there's no field mapping between leads and opportunity contact roles, the required custom field can't be populated. Person Accounts With person accounts enabled, you can convert leads to either person accounts or business accounts. In Lightning Experience, leads that don’t have a value in the Company field are converted to person accounts. Leads that do have a value in the Company field are converted to business accounts. In Salesforce Classic and the Salesforce mobile app, leads without company information can still be converted to an existing business account. To differentiate leads that convert to person accounts from leads that convert to business accounts, use different lead record types and page layouts. Specifically, remove the Company field from the page layouts for leads that convert to person accounts. Then, make the Company field required on the page layouts for leads that convert to business accounts. In the Salesforce mobile app, you can't convert a lead to a person account if the person account name already exists. Record Types If the lead has a record type, the default record type of the user converting the lead is assigned to records created during lead conversion. The default record type of the user converting the lead determines the lead source values available during conversion. If the desired lead source values aren’t available, add the values to the default record type of the user converting the lead. For accounts, users can set an overall default record type as well as subdefault record types for business accounts and person accounts. When converting leads, the overall default record type is used. Lead conversion doesn’t use subdefault record types. Salesforce to Salesforce When you convert a lead, Salesforce to Salesforce inactivates the shared record and updates the External Sharing related list in your connection's lead record with an Inactive (converted) status. Due to inactivation of the shared record, changes to the Lead Status during conversion aren't reflected in your connection's lead record. Search Whether a converted lead is searchable differs for Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience. Salesforce Classic: After converting a lead, it’s no longer searchable. However, the new account, contact, or opportunity record created from the converted lead is searchable. Lightning Experience: The converted lead record and the newly created account, contact, or opportunity record are searchable. However, you can’t access the converted lead record from the search results page to view or edit it. As you type the lead name in the search box, you might see search suggestions for leads that you already merged as duplicates. A delay in removing these converted leads from the search index causes this issue. Standard and Custom Lead Fields The system automatically maps standard lead fields to standard account, contact, and opportunity fields. For custom lead fields, your administrator can specify how they map to custom account, contact, and opportunity fields. The system assigns the default picklist values for the account, contact, and opportunity"

This field appears in some reports and shows the GMT date not adjusted to the user's local time zone. The value stored in the lead's CreatedDate field includes both the date and time and is converted to the user's time zone. Workflow You can't convert a lead that’s associated with an active approval process or has pending workflow actions. Converting a lead to a person account doesn’t trigger workflow rules. When a lead is converted by someone who isn't the lead owner, all workflow tasks associated with the lead that are assigned to that user, except email alerts, are reassigned to the lead owner. Workflow tasks assigned to users other than the lead owner and lead converter aren't changed. If validation and triggers for lead conversion are enabled, then converting a lead can trigger a workflow action on a lead. For example, if an active workflow rule updates a lead field or transfers the owner of a lead, that rule can trigger when the lead is converted. However, because of the conversion, the lead isn’t visible on the Leads tab. Allow the workflow process to finish before updating lead fields, otherwise save or lead convert fails. A workflow rule can create a task because of a lead conversion. In that case, Salesforce assigns the task to the new contact and relates it to the associated account or opportunity.

While splits are being enabled, a script temporarily disables validation rules, Apex triggers, and workflows for opportunity team records; mass reassignment of opportunity team members; and mass transfer of accounts and opportunities. If you enable opportunity splits while you’re running a mass operation, such as Mass Transfer or Mass Reassign Team Member, enablement of splits can fail. Resolve inactive currencies. If inactive currencies were active in the past, those currencies are probably still used on some opportunity records. When inactive currency is used on opportunities, the splits enablement process fails. To prevent failure, do one of the following. While splits enablement is in progress, temporarily make inactive currencies active. Delete the opportunities with the inactive currency. This solution works best when you have only a few opportunities with an inactive currency that you don’t need for reporting or historical purposes. Handle automated process users related to opportunities. Opportunities owned by users created during automatic processes such as Apex triggers, workflows, and Marketing Cloud Account Engagement integration block opportunity splits enablement. To prevent the process from failing, transfer ownership of their opportunities to active users. Also, if you have few process users and you don’t need their opportunities for reporting or historical purposes, delete all of their opportunities.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions In Sales Cloud, also available in: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions NOTE Your user permissions determine which tasks you can perform. See your Salesforce admin for help with any tasks that you can’t perform on your own. Relevant price books, products, and list prices must be active in an opportunity before you can create a quote for the opportunity. Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Edition orgs can activate record types and ask you to choose a Record Type when creating a quote. Record types determine the picklist values and business processes that are available when you create or edit a record. If you use divisions (Salesforce Classic only), the division of a new quote is automatically set to the division of the related opportunity. Quotes don’t support division filters. You can sort up to 200 quote lines. If your quote has more than 200 line items, sorting is done via the API. When you sort quote line items, the sort order updates in PDF quotes and in synced opportunities. When a quote is synced with an opportunity then you add a line item to the quote, the new line item is copied to the opportunity as a product in the Products related list. If an opportunity is syncing with a quote, deleting the quote line item deletes the corresponding product from the opportunity’s Products related list. Opportunity Name isn’t a required field on the quote record page layout. Custom field syncing isn’t supported. When a quote is created from the API, the quote line items aren’t created based on the opportunity line items. New opportunity line items are created based on the quote line items. If a product has default schedules, the schedules aren’t created when you add a line item to a quote. If the line item is copied from the opportunity, you can view the schedule from the opportunity. To change the schedule, edit the product record directly. If you have a quote line item with a discount, and the product has a default schedule on the product record or an individual schedule on the opportunity product record, you can’t edit the Discount field of the line item. Creating a quote via New Quote on the Quote related list copies the opportunity products to the quote line items. Custom buttons or quick actions don't automatically create quote line items."

If you enable advanced currency management, see Editing Dated Exchange Rates. Companies can use multiple currencies in opportunities, forecasts, reports, quotes, and other currency fields. The administrator sets the corporate currency, which reflects the currency of the corporate headquarters. The administrator also maintains the list of active currencies and their conversion rates relative to the corporate currency. The active currencies represent the countries in which the company does business. Only active currencies can be used in currency amount fields. Each user has a personal currency, which is used as the default currency in quotas, opportunities, quotes, and reports. Users can also create opportunities and enter amounts using other active currencies. All standard and custom object records with currency fields have a field that specifies the currency to use for all amount fields in that record. Click Edit to display this editable Currency field on a record. For example, you can set the Account Currency to US dollars so that the Annual Revenue shows in dollars for one of your American accounts. All currency amounts are displayed in the default currency of the record. Administrators can choose whether to also display, in parentheses, the user’s personal currency if it’s different from the currency of the record. When you change the default currency of a record, currency amounts aren’t converted. They display the new currency code. NOTE If your org uses advanced currency management, the opportunity close date determines which conversion rate to use when displaying currency amounts. Amounts in reports are shown in their original currencies, but can be displayed in any active currency. You can change the currency used for report totals by selecting a currency from Show | Currencies. The default value is your personal currency. For any amount, you can choose to display the Converted column—for example, Annual Revenue Converted—which shows amounts in the currency you select. Custom formula fields aren’t tied to any particular currency. If the result of a formula field is a currency amount, it displays in the currency of the associated record. This rule is also true for cross-object formulas that reference merge fields with different currencies, and formulas in workflow rules and approval processes. However, workflow rules and approval processes that use filters instead of formulas convert all currency values to the corporate currency.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Starter, Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Pro Suite, and Developer Editions with Sales Cloud What Is a Lead? Leads are people who are interested in your product and service. Converting leads to loyal customers provide success within a business. By managing your leads in a systematic and structured way, you can increase both the numbers of leads you generate and how many leads you convert. What are the advantages of using leads? Using leads allows your company to maintain two separate lists - one for prospective customers and one for existing customers. You can store your prospects as leads, and then when a lead becomes qualified, you can convert it to an account, contact, and, optionally, an opportunity. Can I automatically email leads that come from my website? Yes. You can create auto-response rules to email these prospects using templates that vary based on criteria that you set up. Can I capture leads from multiple web pages? Yes. Insert the generated HTML code into the web pages from which you want to capture leads. Whenever someone submits information on any of those web pages, a lead is created. Can I convert existing accounts or contacts into leads? No. As an alternative, create an opportunity for the account or contact. If you prefer to use a lead, create a report containing the accounts or contacts you want to convert into leads, export them, and then import them as leads. How are lead fields mapped to other fields during conversion? When you convert a lead, data in standard lead fields is transferred into standard account, contact, and opportunity fields. For custom lead fields, the data is mapped to custom account, contact, and opportunity fields as specified by your admin. How can I be sure that leads aren’t lost? The daily limit for Web-to-Lead requests is 500. If your organization exceeds its daily Web-to-Lead limit, the Default Lead Creator (specified in the Web-to-Lead setup page) receives an email containing the additional lead information. How can I tell which of my leads are new? When a lead is assigned to you, either manually transferred, imported, or generated from the web, the lead is marked as “Unread,” that is, it has a check mark in the Unread column on leads list views. How can our webmaster test the Web-to-Lead page? Add the following line to your Web-to-Lead page code if you want to see a debugging page when you submit the form. Don't forget to remove this line before releasing the Web-to-Lead page on your website. How many leads can we capture from our website? In Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Performance, and Developer Edition organizations, you can capture up to 500 leads in a 24-hour period. What happens when I convert leads? When you convert a lead, Salesforce creates an account, contact, and optionally an opportunity, using information from the lead you’re converting. What"

Its marketing manager, Kamal, creates two campaigns: Whitepaper - First Timers and Whitepaper - New Investors, which roll up to the parent campaign Whitepapers. When a buyer enters information in the web-to-lead form on the Happy Homes website, the submission creates a lead record. The lead record can be added as a campaign member with a status of Downloaded. Over time, the two white papers get a lot of traffic. The sales team follows up on the leads while Kamal reviews which audience segment is more engaged. Because he organizes his campaigns by the Campaign Type field, he can also investigate how white papers stack up against emails, webinars, and other marketing efforts."

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Available with Revenue Intelligence, which is available for an additional cost in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions Ensuring Sales Rep Accountability with Pipeline Inspection (English Only) Filtering If a search returns 2,000 or more records, a total for the selected metric isn’t shown. The Moved Out metric looks at opportunities with close dates within 6 months after the selected period to determine whether those deals meet the Moved Out criteria. The searched records count toward the record limit. Even if the maximum record limit is reached for any of the pipeline metrics, and the total for the metric isn’t shown, the list still shows records. When filtering by a pipeline metric, the list sometimes shows fewer than the maximum opportunities even when the actual number of matching opportunities is more than the maximum. The All Opportunities owner filter isn’t supported. You can filter by opportunity owner, opportunity teams, or territories. To filter by any user’s opportunities, make sure you have View All Records permission on opportunities. Managers can see deals for users who have subordinate roles in the role hierarchy, where the user is either the opportunity owner or on the opportunity team. Managers can also see deals for users with subordinate portal roles. To see opportunities where your reports are on the opportunity team, make sure the manager and the opportunity team members are in the same branch of the role hierarchy. If you don't use a role hierarchy, add the opportunity team members to the Opportunity Team related list. Filter logic is supported for the AND, NOT, and OR operators. Pipeline Views and Custom Filters The default pipeline views are My Pipeline and My Important Opportunities. You can’t share, clone, or delete default pipeline views. To create or edit public pipeline views, users must have the Manage Public List Views permission. Other users can only create private views. Pipeline views are created with fields that users have permission to view. When users gain access to fields they didn't previously have access to, they can manually add the fields to their private views. Users with the Manage Public List Views permission can add the fields to public views. Pipeline views and saved filters aren’t shared between Pipeline Inspection and Opportunity list views. To create and edit all types of list views, users must have the Create and Customize List Views permission. When a user is saved in the Owner filter, you can't update the sharing settings for a pipeline view.

New calls and events show at the time they’re created, regardless of their status. The Stage and Forecast Category changes shown in red and green text with arrows indicate stages or categories that are advancing or reverting. The progression of stages follows the order set by your Salesforce admin when they selected the picklist values for opportunity stages and mapped them to forecast categories. Opportunities Marked as Important Users can mark up to 200 opportunities as important. Important opportunities are visible only to the user who marked them and can’t be shared with other users. You can see and mark opportunities as important in Pipeline Inspection only. Inline Editing Not all fields in the list view can be inline edited. Editable fields have a pencil when you hover over the field. Non-editable cells have a lock . When you’re making inline edits, required fields can’t be left blank and read-only fields can’t be edited. However, field-level security (FLS) settings take precedence over how a field is configured on the page layout. For example, if a field is set to Read-Only for a specific profile, but Editable on the page layout, users with that profile can’t inline edit the field in the list view. You can edit the following field types inline in Pipeline Inspection: Checkbox, Currency, Date, Email, External Lookup, Lookup, Number, Percent, Picklist, Multi-Select Picklist, Phone, Text, and URL. These opportunity fields are also editable inline: Amount (on opportunities without products), Close Date, Quantity, and Stage. Stage is editable inline only when no other validations or dependent fields have been added. You can’t edit the Forecast Category and Probability fields, because these fields are updated when the Stage field is edited. Although you can edit dependent picklist fields in Opportunity list views, they aren’t editable inline in Pipeline Inspection. You can edit opportunities of multiple record types inline in the same list view. Activity Timeline in Side Panel The filter selections must be set each time you view an opportunity.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: All Account Engagement Editions with Salesforce Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions To streamline the way that you provide multifaceted campaign data to sales and marketing teams, connect your Salesforce and Account Engagement campaigns. As a prospect interacts with the marketing assets on a Account Engagement campaign, metrics are pushed to its equivalent Salesforce record. From there, marketers can track influence, and sales users can clearly see the prospect’s journey to becoming an opportunity. NOTE If you purchased Account Engagement after March 22, 2019, Connected Campaigns is partially enabled by default. You can create campaigns in Salesforce only and have access to Engagement History features. Play a Demo: Enable Connected Campaigns (English Only) Get Started with Connected Campaigns If you purchased Account Engagement after March 22, 2019, Connected Campaigns is partially enabled by default. To configure campaigns to work best for your business, complete a few tasks. Considerations for Connecting Campaigns If you’re setting up Connected Campaigns in a business unit with existing campaigns, keep these considerations in mind. Migrate to Connected Campaigns Use Salesforce campaigns to align with revenue teams and get access to Salesforce reporting and other platform functionality. To activate these benefits, users who have Account Engagement campaigns must enable Connected Campaigns and map their records. Campaign Member Sync As you connect your campaigns, decide whether to sync prospects into those campaigns. When you turn on Member Sync for connected campaigns, prospects appear in Salesforce as campaign members. Engagement History for Campaigns Together, Salesforce and Marketing Cloud Account Engagement track valuable engagement data that can tell you how well your marketing assets resonate with your customer base. Turn on Engagement History in Salesforce and choose where to surface this valuable data in the form of fields, related lists, and data visualization.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic for some features and Lightning Experience for all features Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud A territory can have inherited account assignment rules, meaning that the rules were created somewhere higher in the territory hierarchy and also impact the given territory. A territory can have locally defined account assignment rules, meaning that the rule was associated at the given territory. If a territory doesn't have any inherited or locally defined account assignment rules, then it only contains accounts that were associated manually. If an account matches all inherited and locally defined account assignment rules for multiple territories on the same branch of the hierarchy, the account is assigned to the lowest matching territory. If a territory has multiple locally defined account assignment rules, an account is assigned to the territory only if it matches all locally defined account assignment rules on the territory. When referring to picklist values in your account assignment rules, specify the API name instead of its corresponding value. That way, your account assignment rules reflect any updates to picklist values. For example, you refer to the picklist API name Agriculture_Sales. You change its corresponding value from Agriculture Sales to Agriculture. Account assignment rules now reflect Agriculture. EXAMPLE Territory A has four rules marked “Apply to child territories“ and is a parent of territory B. Territory B has three rules not marked “Apply to child territories” and is a parent of territory C. Territory C has two rules. If you assign an account that matches all of territory A’s and territory C’s rules but only one of territory B’s rules, the account is assigned to territory C. However, if territory B’s rules are marked ‘Apply to child territories,” the account is assigned only to territory A."

Select Revenue Insights, and click Add 1 Nav Item and click Save. Verify Your Permission Settings When you turn on CRM Analytics for your org, a default Analytics Integration User is created. This \"user\" accesses the data within Salesforce when the recipe is used to bring data in as datasets to CRM Analytics. It's important that this user has the proper level of permissions to read the data you're trying to pull from the org to CRM Analytics. For example, the integration user must have object-level access to all the objects from which data you want to pull. And you need field level access to the fields within those objects.

Save your changes. To add a filter to the Overview dashboard: NOTE The Overview page combines multiple datasets and live queries. The challenge of adding a filter here means that the field-selected needs to apply to all of the data sources. For example, you want to add a Region filter, such as Billing Country, to the dashboard. This field is in the Opportunity RevInsights dataset so most of the widgets on Overview will facet automatically by default. However, the SOQL queries look at the ForecastingItem object. This object doesn’t have a way to filter by country because the forecast is done at the individual person level. Drag a list filter to the desired location on the dashboard. NOTE Don’t select global filters. Select the dataset that includes your field. Salesforce recommends you use the Opportunity RevInsights dataset because most queries on the dashboard use this dataset. Select a field and configure the design. Open up the dataset connections and add a connection for your field, if applicable. Most queries on Overview, Team Performance, and Sales Performance tabs can facet based on these steps. The top section on the Overview dashboard, including the Team Quota Attainment, KPIs, as well as the forecasting chart may not facet. The faceting doesn’t happen because there are live queries based on Forecasting Item. The dashboard uses the following datasets: Opportunity RevInsights UserRole OpptyProduct Activity OpportunityHistory Forecasting Quota Modify queries beginning with soql_. If there’s a field that can be found in the ForecastingItem object and is pulled in for the Revenue Insights app, in addition to adding dataset connections, the soql queries require an additional binding.

Use campaigns to communicate and share resources with coworkers during planning and execution, and then monitor and report on campaign successes. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Create or Edit a Campaign To get started with a new campaign, create a record by filling in the required fields Campaign Name and Currency. To optimize your campaign records for monitoring and reporting, provide details in the remaining fields, such as type and budget. You can also create a campaign by cloning another campaign record. Clone a Campaign with Related Records Clone a campaign record when it contains helpful details you want to use again. When you use the Clone with Related operation, you can choose which field values and related marketing assets to copy to the new campaign. Create a Campaign Hierarchy To organize campaigns and link them together, you can associate them with parent and child relationships in a campaign hierarchy. When you run reports, metrics from the child campaigns roll up to the parent. Share Campaigns Like all Salesforce objects, campaigns are governed by your sharing model. To make sure that the right colleagues have access to the right campaigns, a campaign owner can extend sharing for your own campaigns one by one. Track Campaign Field History You can track the changes made to selected fields on the campaign. Each time a user modifies a tracked field, the date, time, user, and changes appear in the related list."

Your organization expects more opportunities within the US east coast than the US west coast in the coming year, so the East Coast territory type is assigned priority 001 and the West Coast territory type is assigned 005.

For example, suppose that the master record “Joseph Blake” is a member of the “Blake Family” and “Blake Law Firm” relationship groups. “Joseph Blake” remains a member of those relationship groups. The master record replaces the non-master records in all other relationship groups involved in the merge. For example, suppose that the non-master record “Joe Blake” is a member of “Blake Trust Beneficiaries.” The master record is transferred to Joe Blake’s membership in Blake Trust Beneficiaries. If multiple non-master records belong to a relationship group that the master record doesn’t belong to, the master record acquires membership as follows: In the relationship group of the non-master account with higher priority (primary versus secondary) In the relationship group whose member record was most recently modified in the group For example, suppose that the non-master records “JR Blake” and “Joe Blake” both are members of “Acme LLP” and JR Blake is primary.

From this list, you can reference the model’s associated assignment rules and the resulting account-to-territory assignments generated by the rules. You can archive a model only if it’s in the Active state. After archiving a model, you can’t return it to the Active state or the Planning state. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic for some features and Lightning Experience for all features Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud USER PERMISSIONS NEEDED To archive a territory model: Manage Territories AND View Setup and Configuration WARNING When you archive a territory model, Salesforce deletes your territory forecasts, forecast types, quotas, and adjustments. After you activate another territory model, you must re-create territory forecast types for it. Before you archive a territory model, consider these options. Run the opportunity territory assignment filter, and then take screenshots of the forecasts page. Create a snapshot. The snapshot is not deleted as part of the archiving process. Export your forecasting records, including forecasting items, facts, quotas, and adjustments. When you archive a territory model, Salesforce also deletes data related to sharing and group associations by territory. To retain this data, export the related records before you archive the territory model. While it’s not required, we recommend that you update the territories on opportunity splits and opportunity product splits after you archive the model and activate a new one. Perform this update with the filter-based opportunity territory assignment tool, or reassign territories manually or by using Data Loader. If you’ve enabled deferred group membership calculation, we recommend suspending it to avoid issues with group membership cleanup during territory model archival. You can re-enable deferred group membership calculation after archival is completed. From Setup, enter Territory Models in the Quick Find box, then select Territory Models. Open your active territory model. Click Archive, and then click Archive Territory Model to confirm. The model state changes to Archiving while Salesforce processes your request. When processing is complete, the model state changes to Archived, and you receive a confirmation via email. This process can take some time, depending on the size and complexity of your organization.

Einstein Account Management is powered by CRM Analytics, so you must enable CRM Analytics. Einstein Account Management requires you to have Customer Insights version 1.5 or higher enabled and configured. By default, the auto-installed version is prioritized during setup. If multiple versions of Customer Insights have been created, Einstein Account Management uses the most recently installed compatible version. Einstein Account Management uses the same security predicate as your Customer Insights app. If you selected a custom security predicate from the wizard, it inherits this selection Einstein Account Management uses the same field as your Customer Insights app to track the total amount of the opportunity. By default the amount field is used. To create the default Einstein Discovery Account Health model, you must have 400 unique accounts that experienced a change in win rate between two specified time periods: 12-6 months ago, and 6 months ago to present. If you don’t yet have enough data, the Einstein Discovery models can’t be created initially. In this case, the app is created without Einstein Discovery models. You can go back later and recreate the app when you later have enough data. For more information about Einstein Discovery specified limits, see Einstein Discovery Limits. To create the default Einstein Discovery Account Upside model, you need at least 400 unique accounts that experienced a change in product count or quantity between two specified time periods. For more information about Einstein Discovery specified limits, see Einstein Discovery Limits. Salesforce recommends that you schedule the Einstein Account Management recipe to run on a regular cadence that is scheduled within 24 hours of your Customer Insights recipes. Note these requirements for using Einstein Account Management: NOTE When you turn on CRM Analytics for your org, a default Analytics Integration User is created. This \"user\" accesses the data within Salesforce when the recipe is used to bring data in as datasets to CRM Analytics. It's important that this user has the proper level of permissions to access your data. For example, the integration user needs have object level access to all the objects from which data you want to pull, and field level access to the fields within those objects. If you have trouble in creating your app or can’t view data, you sometimes must modify either object or field permissions to allow the integration user to access them. Recipes, ED Models, Components, and Datasets The Einstein Account Management Accounts Recipe is used in Einstein Account Management: This recipe pulls in Account information and adds multiple aggregated metrics across Opportunities, Tasks, Events, Products, and LineItems.

The default type measures on the Amount field, by close date, and is based on the user role hierarchy. You can modify the opportunity list, select the columns to show in the forecast summary, apply filters, and modify the custom columns for that type. Or, create your own types to meet your business needs. Enabling multiple forecast types allows a different combination of the data shown for each forecast.

Custom Measures If you have custom currency or number fields on the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, Opportunity Split, or Line Item Schedule object, you can forecast on the values in those fields. To forecast on revenue, use a custom currency field. To forecast on quantity, use a custom number field. Expected Revenue If the value of the Amount field and the actual revenue brought in by the opportunity often differ, the Expected Revenue field on opportunities is useful. If your sales team anticipates this difference, consider using the Expected Revenue field and forecasting on it. You can forecast on revenue but not quantity. You can forecast on the Expected Revenue field regardless of whether you use opportunity splits with it. Regardless of whether you use splits with the Expected Revenue field, you must enable team selling, opportunity splits, and a custom split type for it. Forecast Filters To include or exclude opportunity data from a forecast type, add a custom filter based on fields in the Opportunity object. For example, you can set up a custom filter for a forecast type that includes only renewal opportunities. When creating or modifying custom filters, keep these considerations in mind. Filter definitions aren’t editable after activating or reactivating the forecast type. Filter definitions support up to three conditions and use the AND operator only. Filters don’t support using formula fields or custom multiselect picklist fields. When you’re filtering on currency fields and you have a single currency enabled, the absolute value is used in the filter condition. If you have multiple currencies enabled, the corporate currency is used in the filter condition. Legacy forecast types that come ready-to-use with Forecasting don’t support custom filters. Forecast Groups with Custom Picklists You can group forecasts into segments other than product families that make sense for your business. For example, define forecasts to group by industry or business unit. Keep these considerations in mind. Forecast groups are available for forecast types based on the Opportunity and Opportunity Product objects. Custom, single-selection picklist fields on the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, or Product objects are available as forecast groups. Make your group and group value selections as you define the forecast type. We recommend completing the picklist field on each opportunity record. To include items that don’t have a value selected for the picklist, select Not Categorized when you select the group values for the forecast type. If a picklist selected as a forecast group in a forecast type is deactivated, forecasts continue to include opportunities that have a value selected for the picklist. Forecast groups using custom picklists aren’t available in Salesforce Classic or in the Salesforce mobile app. Opportunity Product Splits If your sales team uses team selling and opportunity product splits, use an opportunity product splits revenue forecast.

Opportunity Revenue Splits If your sales team uses team selling and opportunity splits, use an opportunity splits revenue forecast. Keep these considerations in mind. You must have team selling, opportunity splits, and the revenue split type enabled. In Salesforce Classic, an opportunity that contains only a single 100% revenue split shows “--” for the split percentage in the opportunity list. Overlay Splits Use overlay splits to track revenue from sales team members who help close opportunities but aren’t directly responsible for them. You must have team selling, opportunity splits, and the overlay split type enabled. The overlay splits on a specific opportunity aren’t required to total 100%. Product Families If your company groups its products and services into families and wants to forecast based on those families, keep these considerations in mind. If you’re using Lightning Experience, you choose the product families to forecast on. The more product families you choose, the more rows appear in the forecasts grid. The forecasts grid shows up to 2,000 rows. The Forecasted Amount column in the opportunity list on the forecasts page shows the product family totals, not the overall opportunity totals that roll up into the forecast amounts. We recommend that you add this column to the opportunity list. Forecast users can view individual product family forecasts for users they have access to view. We recommend completing the Product Family field on each product record. Forecasts for products without a Product Family value appear in a forecast row called Products Not Categorized. If an opportunity lacks products, the opportunity amount or quantity also appears in this row. Product family forecast totals aren’t available in Salesforce Classic. If users adjust their product family forecasts in Lightning Experience, not every total in the Salesforce Classic forecasts grid reflects the adjustments. In Salesforce Classic, a manager’s own product family forecasts aren’t available, so they can’t be adjusted. You can set separate product family quotas for each sales rep but not a single quota for each sales rep. Territories If you use Sales Territories, you can forecast based on the territory hierarchy.

Configure Data Cloud for Consumption Forecasting To set up Consumption Forecasting, enable and configure Data Cloud so you can leverage the data effectively. Enable Data Cloud in the same Salesforce org. Assign the Forecast Manager Role The forecasts hierarchy determines how forecasts roll up within your Salesforce org and who can view and adjust them. The forecast hierarchy is based on the user role hierarchy. Deploy the Forecasting Data Kit To configure a consumption forecast type, import the standard objects required for forecasting from your Salesforce org to Data Cloud. Deploying the Forecasting data kit creates the data lake and data model objects for those standard objects. Create DLOs for Your Standard Objects If you can't deploy the Forecasting data kit, you can manually configure data streams and DMO mappings for the standard objects. Create DMOs for Consumption-Based Data The consumption-based data includes details of real usage and estimates of future usage of each product or service that you want to forecast. Set Relationships Among DMOs Set the relationships among the DMOs. These relationships help you determine forecast rollups in the Choose Forecasting Dimensions section while creating a consumption forecast type. Create a Consumption-Based Forecast Type You configure a consumption-based forecast type by selecting the data source for your forecast, setting up forecast rollups, choosing columns to display, and selecting the date type for forecast calculations. After you complete the setup, the forecast type appears as a tab on the forecasts page, where your teams can view and forecast revenues."

    "chunk_text": "Rollup Methods for Pipeline Forecasts Learn about methods for rolling up opportunities into forecasts for your sales teams. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud Single forecast category rollups combine the opportunities within each forecast category into separate forecasts for each category. Cumulative forecast rollups combine opportunities from multiple forecast categories into cumulative forecast categories. This setting is the default. Watch a video to learn how cumulative rollups work. NOTE The examples in this topic use the four forecast categories that are enabled by default. You can show a Most Likely category in Lightning Experience, rename single category rollups, and rename cumulative rollups. When added, Most Likely appears in the forecasts grid between Commit and Best Case. ROLLUP METHOD COLUMN NAME ON THE FORECASTS PAGE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ROLL UP TO IT Single Category Pipeline Pipeline Best Case* Best Case Commit* Commit Closed Closed Cumulative Open Pipeline Pipeline Best Case Commit Best Case Forecast Best Case Commit Closed Commit Forecast Commit Closed Closed Only Closed * If forecasts adjustments are enabled and configured to show in columns, these column names are My Best Case and My Commit, respectively. Advantages of Cumulative Forecast Rollups With single category rollups, each total and subtotal represents opportunities from only one of the forecast categories. With this type of rollup, if forecast users want to see the total that they’re going to bring for the month or quarter, they add the Best Case, Commit, and Closed forecasts together. EXAMPLE: SINGLE CATEGORY ROLLUPS Forecast amounts Closed Commit Best Case Pipeline $50 $100 $150 $200 Opportunities Closed Commit Best Case Pipeline $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 With cumulative rollups, the forecast columns show cumulative amounts from the opportunities in the named forecast category and subsequent categories in your sales pipeline. This view makes it easy for sales team members to see the total numbers that they’re likely to bring in without combining the category totals themselves. For example, this table shows the cumulative forecast rollup amounts when there are four Pipeline, three Best Case, two Commit, and one Closed opportunity, each worth $50. EXAMPLE: CUMULATIVE ROLLUPS Forecast amounts Closed Only Commit Forecast Best Case Forecast Open Pipeline $50 $150 $300 $450 Opportunities Closed Commit Best Case Pipeline $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 Select a Pipeline Forecast Rollup Method Choose between cumulative rollup columns or single category columns. Single category rollups are selected by default, but you can change this setting as needed."

With forecast charts, see the changes to the current period’s forecasts across forecast types and measure how this period’s forecasts compares to past periods, without having to manually crunch the numbers. Reviewing Week-to-Week Forecast Changes Review how forecasts have changed throughout the current period with the Weekly Changes chart. The chart includes key metrics and a visual representation of changes as the period has progressed. The information that’s available to you in the chart depends on enabled features and how long forecast data is retained. Finding Trends Across Forecast Periods Evaluate how this forecast period compares to the forecasts at the same point in past periods in the Monthly or Quarterly Trends chart.

When you begin to convert a lead, possible matches appear based on matching rules using standard fields.

    "chunk_text": "Considerations for Setting Prices If you’re an admin or a sales operations manager, consider key points before you set prices for your products in Salesforce. REQUIRED EDITIONS Products, product schedules, price books, and quotes available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Orders available in Salesforce Classic Products, product schedules, price books, and orders available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Quotes available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud The following price types are available. A standard price is the default price that you associate with a product. It’s automatically included in your standard price book. A list price is the custom price that you associate with a product in a custom price book. For example, you can maintain one set of prices for domestic orders and another for international orders. Sales prices are the actual prices that sales reps specify for the products that they add to opportunities and quotes. Sales prices can be the same as the list prices from the price book that’s used for the opportunity or quote, or they can include discounts or other modifications. Before you can add a new product to an opportunity, quote, or custom price book, add a standard price to the product, and mark it as active. This pricing is the default pricing of the product. Before you can assign list prices for products, create custom price books. List prices are available to use when you add products to an opportunity or quote from a custom price book. To represent the price, for example, $100.00, enter 100 or 100.00, with or without the $ symbol. You can expand the format of your price fields to up to eight decimal places. To change your decimal place settings, contact Salesforce. Considerations When Using the Salesforce Classic User Interface You can add standard or list prices only through the multiline add pages (the Add Standard Price page and the Add List Price page). These pages don’t support custom fields. To add standard or list prices and populate custom fields, add the price book entry via the multiline add pages, navigate to the Price Book Entry Edit page for the added record, and then update the custom fields. NOTE This consideration doesn’t affect price book entries that were created or edited by using Data Loader or the API. If the price book entry contains required custom fields, you can’t create price book entries in the user interface. You can create these price book entries only by using Data Loader or the API. You can edit prices in either of the following locations. The multiline edit pages (the Edit Standard Price page and the Edit List Price page) The Price Book Entry Edit page"

In Lightning Experience, contact roles are available for opportunities, contracts, and cases. Although contact roles work more or less the same for each available object, they work independently. Therefore, you need to set them up and use them separately for each object. In a record’s Contact Roles related list, click New. To add contacts to an opportunity, select a role for each contact in the list you wish to add. To add contacts to an account, contract or case, use the lookup icon to choose a contact or person account. Select a role for the contact. Optionally, designate a primary contact for the record. Cases don’t have this option. Save your changes. It can take up to 30 minutes before the new contact role appears in the Contact Roles related list. For example, at AW Computing, Mary Smith evaluates all proposals and then forwards them to Tom Jones for a final decision. In the opportunity record for AW Computing, you designate Mary Smith as the Evaluator and Tom Jones as the Decision Maker. Now you know who to contact first!

Forecast Your Consumption Revenue Use Consumption Forecasts to view and predict revenue for a consumption-based business within a specific timeframe. The forecasts page consists of various forecast types, each providing a consolidated view. These forecasts display totals and subtotals of consumption amounts, organized by forecast rollup and time period. Forecasts can include adjustments made by forecast managers to their associates' forecasts and by associates to their own forecasts. Change Your Forecast Date Range on the Forecasts Page Your Salesforce admin sets up a default forecast date range display. For example, your default can be three months into the future. Use this range, or change the date range that’s shown for your own forecast. Share Forecasts with Stakeholders Increase visibility into your forecast and ensure stakeholders can view, adjust, submit, and report on projected sales. For example, a sales manager can share her forecasts with Sales Ops for reporting purposes, or with another sales manager while she’s out of the office. Guidelines for Refreshing Forecasts Certain actions can change forecasts. For example, while you’re viewing the forecasts page, your subordinates can edit related opportunities and adjust the forecasts of their own subordinates. And you can adjust one of your subordinates’ forecasts from your own page. To see these changes, refresh the forecasts page."

You can’t merge person accounts that are enabled as portal or Experience Cloud site users. See Merge Duplicate Accounts. Account Quick Create On the accounts page in Salesforce Classic, fields in the Quick Create area depend on whether the default record type is set to person account or business account. Accounts Person accounts can’t be included in account hierarchies. To allow users to include person accounts in contact hierarchies, turn on the Reports To field. Person accounts can’t be parent accounts of other accounts or of contacts. However, you can use Contacts to Multiple Accounts to create indirect relationships between a person account and another person account, business account, or contact. And, you can use the Reports To field to create associations between person accounts and other person accounts and contacts in a reporting structure. In Lightning Experience orgs where Shared Activities isn’t enabled, activity visibility differs for an activity associated with a person account through the Name field. In this case, the activity is visible in the person account’s Activity Timeline only. It isn’t visible in activity related lists: Open Activities and Activity History. Activities Person accounts can be associated with events or tasks by using the Name or the Related To field. Person accounts can be invited to events. For users to request a meeting with a person account, the Email field must be included in the person account page layout. Approval processes When creating approval processes for person accounts, the Account Name field isn’t accepted as a valid entry criteria. Use the First Name and Last Name fields instead. Assets On assets, person accounts can be entered in the Account field, the Contact field, or both. Campaigns Person accounts can be added to campaigns and have a Campaign History related list.

Those fields differ depending on the kinds of records that your reps plot. Specifically: Accounts require Billing Latitude and Billing Longitude fields. Contacts require Mailing Latitude and Mailing Longitude fields. Leads require Latitude and Longitude fields. That way, the map can: Show up to 50 records at a time, providing they include accurate addresses. Include pagination that lets reps access other records in batches of 50 or fewer. But for your reps to plot records without latitude and longitude coordinates, Salesforce Maps Lite generates coordinates for them. Generated coordinates last for just that session in Salesforce Maps Lite. Work with records in bulk It includes a list of the records that correspond with the record markers that appear on the map. The list: Shows up to 50 records simultaneously. Provides up to 15 fields for each record based on the fields that appear in the object’s list views. Lets reps locate a specific record marker on the map when they select its corresponding record from the list. Indicates which records don’t appear on the map because they require address corrections. Perform actions on individual records It includes functions directly in record markers on the map. When your reps select record markers: The same fields appear as the ones in the list of records.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud General Guidelines Track important details at the opportunity level. Measure everything related to potential deals—activities such as emails, meetings, and outreach—to determine their contributions to revenue. Create actionable tasks with next steps and completion dates pertaining to opportunities. Map your sales stages to forecast categories. To increase your forecast accuracy, adjust close probability based on historical data. When adjusting forecasts, have conversations with your subordinates so that they understand your expectations. Because opportunities can change frequently, revisit forecast adjustments weekly to avoid out-of-date adjustments. To ensure that everyone can access the forecasts they need, designate each sales manager with subordinates as a forecast manager in your role-based forecast hierarchy. Also assign a territory manager to each territory for which you want rolled-up forecasts. Customize your forecast category names so they match your business process and terminology. Navigating Forecast Information Forecast users can jump to the forecasts of users and territories that they have access to view. Begin typing a name in the search (Lightning Experience) or “Jump to” (Salesforce Classic) box, and then select the name. If you’ve enabled territory forecasts, type three or more letters to see results for users and territories. To expand a row on the forecasts page, click it. Navigation links with the names of forecast managers appear at the top of the page as you drill down through the forecast hierarchy. Click these links to quickly move through the hierarchy. Viewing Forecast Information Keep your window sized to 1,024 pixels or greater. To view forecast amounts in the forecast summary grid without decimal places, select Show Rounded Amounts from the Display Settings. Full amounts that include the decimal places are shown in the opportunity list header when you select the forecast cell. Decimal places are also included when you’re viewing adjustment and change details. Showing rounded amounts can help maximize screen space. In Lightning Experience, if multiple forecast types are enabled, you can select which forecasts you want to view as tabs using the Edit Tab Selections option from the gear icon. In Salesforce Classic, select the forecast from the upper-right dropdown list on the forecasts page. Column width in the forecast grid and the opportunity list is adjustable. In Lightning Experience, a timestamp shows the date and time when the forecasts page was refreshed. In-progress data updates aren’t indicated. In Lightning Experience, rows that have only zero values, including rows with only zero or no quota, are shown by default. To hide all-zero rows except for rollups of subordinates and child territories, deselect Show Rows with All Zero Values in the Display Options on the forecasts page. In Salesforce Classic, this option is available only for product family forecasts. If a coworker has shared forecasts with you, select the coworker’s name"

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions To get the whole picture about your forecast and the pipeline that’s there to fill it, gather and prepare data from these possible sources. DATA TYPE EXAMPLES Sales and service data from Salesforce Leads Opportunities Accounts Open service cases (if you use Service Cloud) Revenue and marketing data from Salesforce Past purchase activity (if you use Revenue Cloud) Billing and subscriptions (if you use Revenue Cloud) Website engagement (if you use Marketing Cloud) Depending on your Salesforce setup, some of this data can be available from external sources. Third-party data Inventory and fulfillment status Consumption rates Conference attendance and webinar engagement Customer survey results Social media sentiment Systems and assets data Network information System performance Device information Combining this data means you can create insights that help to predict your potential sales. These insights are just a few examples. Customer satisfaction. Use your past purchase data with your service case, consumption, and customer survey data to assess overall customer happiness with your products and services, which can influence their potential to buy more. Calculated run rate. Use your Salesforce opportunity data with your billing and shipping data to predict your revenue for the year. Likelihood to Close. Use your Salesforce opportunity data with your consumption rate, past purchases, inventory, and seasonal sales trends to make sure you’re engaging with the customers most likely to close the deal. Propensity to buy. Use your Salesforce opportunity data with past purchase history, conference and webinar attendance, and web engagement data to determine a customer’s interest, propensity, and when they’re likely to make their next purchase. Seasonal Sales Trends. Use your past purchase data with your inventory data to determine whether the inventory on hand meets potential demands and whether enough pipeline exists to meet your forecast during a busy season. Task 1: Configure Users for Data Cloud To work with external data in Salesforce, ensure that Data Cloud is set up and provisioned in your Salesforce org. Assign Data Cloud permission sets to any users that need access to Data Cloud. Task 2: Connect and Map Your Data Sources to Data Cloud To bring your data together, connect your data sources in Data Cloud. Data sources are the places that hold your data. Those places can be Salesforce for lead and opportunity data or third-party sources such as Google Storage or Amazon S3 for conference attendance and webinar engagement.

    "chunk_text": "you connect your data to Data Cloud depends on where the data is coming from. To make sure your data source can be connected to Data Cloud, review the available Data Cloud connectors and integrations. Connect and map your sales and service data. Set up a Salesforce connection in Data Cloud. Install a standard data bundle for Sales Cloud and for Service Cloud. To begin the flow of data to Data Cloud, create a data stream. The standard data bundles automatically map Salesforce standard objects to Data Cloud standard data model objects (DMOs). See Sales and Service Data Bundle Mappings. Connect and map your third-party data sources. Configure third-party data sources by using a connector service or a pre-built connector or integration in Data Cloud Setup. You can also connect data using the Bring Your Own Lake (BYOL) Data Federation in Data Cloud. Create a data stream for each of the external data sources. See Data Sources in Data Cloud. For each external source, map your data to DMOs. Make sure you map all fields that are required for your business. For data available in other clouds, explore the connectors and connector services available. If a connector or service isn’t available, manually ingest the data and map your data accordingly. Task 3: Unify Your Data into Profiles Consolidate your data from all your sources into a comprehensive view of your customers and accounts. From that customer view, you can start to learn more about that customer’s buying trends and how they fit into your forecast. Create an identity resolution ruleset. Add match rules. Run the ruleset and then view unified profile results in Profile Explorer. Task 4: Analyze Data with Calculated Insights With all your data now safely in Data Cloud, you’re ready to build the insights that join your data together. For example, create insights that correlate past purchasing patterns from customers with open opportunities, or take a closer look at subscription and web engagement data to determine what upsell or cross-selling opportunities can boost your pipeline. Each insight you create provides better visibility into your pipeline and forecast so you can make forecast adjustments and engage with the right customers to ensure key deals close on time. Knowing exactly where your forecast stands gives you time to update your account strategies to increase your pipeline to ensure you hit your forecast goal. Sales leaders work together to decide which metrics and insights they need and help to identify what data is needed to arrive at that metric. For example, to see the total amount spent by a customer, which can influence future spending habits and your pipeline, you need the customer’s past purchase data. Create the calculated insight. Verify the insight in Data Explorer. To verify the calculation, run or schedule the SQL job. See Enhance Data in Data Cloud in Trailhead to learn more about the types of insights available and how to build your insight expressions. What’s Next Now that your data is connected together, you"

These segments can be used to build email campaigns or to create a report or dashboard for sales leaders that can be useful when forecasting. Enrich Sales Cloud records with insights.

Deactivation doesn’t affect the history of an opportunity line item. Remove the related product or price book from all opportunities and quotes. When you try to remove a product or price book that’s used on an opportunity or quote, Salesforce displays a list of the opportunities or quotes that use it. If you remove a price book, remove it from each opportunity and quote that’s listed. If you remove a product, remove it from each opportunity and quote that uses it.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: All Account Engagement Editions with Salesforce Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions USER PERMISSIONS NEEDED To connect campaigns with Salesforce Data Loader: Account Engagement Administrator role NOTE Pardot is now known as Marketing Cloud Account Engagement. We wish we could snap our fingers to update the name everywhere, but you can expect to see the previous name in a few places until we replace it, including in the app itself. Open the Account Engagement Campaigns page. In Account Engagement, select Marketing and then Campaigns. In the Lightning app, select Account Engagement Campaigns. This tab isn’t visible by default—an admin must add it. Click Bulk Connect Pardot Campaigns to New Salesforce Campaigns. Salesforce exports the file NewConnectedCampaigns.csv, which contains a list of your unconnected campaigns. If your org has required custom fields for campaigns, add a column for each custom field name to the CSV file. Log in with your Salesforce account credentials so you can insert, update, or delete data using Data Loader. Select Data. Select Show all Salesforce objects, and select Campaign. Click Browse, and open the NewConnectedCampaigns.csv file. Click Next and after the object and CSV file are initialized, click OK. Salesforce Data Loader prompts you to map Salesforce campaign fields to the Account Engagement campaign fields in the CSV file. Accept the default mappings. If you added custom field columns to the CSV file, find the field on the left and select its corresponding CSV column. Click Create or Edit a Map, select Auto-Match Fields to Columns, and then click OK. A confirmation page shows the field mappings and the number of new Salesforce campaign records to be created. Click Next, choose the folder to save the campaigns in, and select Finish. Salesforce Data Loader reports the number of campaigns created and any failures. If a campaign fails to create, the reason is listed in the ERROR column. After a short wait, the newly connected campaigns appear in the Connected Campaigns view on the Account Engagement Campaigns page. When you use Salesforce Data Loader to map campaigns, the Pardot Campaign ID field is added to your records for organization purposes. This field isn’t shown on campaigns mapped via other methods, so we recommend that you don’t use the field in reports or page layouts."

Considerations for Using Person Accounts Review how person accounts differ from business accounts and contacts. Considerations for Using Merge Fields for Person Accounts A merge field is a field you can put in an email, an email template, a mail merge template, a custom link, or a formula to incorporate values from a record. You can use merge fields in the subject and body of custom HTML templates. When using merge fields, it’s a good idea to understand how they work and what to expect in your merged documents and emails.

For each opportunity or account you create, the Partners related list allows you to store information about your partners and the roles they play in the opportunity or account. A partner must be an existing account within Salesforce. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Salesforce Classic Available in: all editions in orgs activated before Summer ’09 Available in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions in orgs activated after Summer ’09 If your organization has been enabled for partners, you can create partner accounts. Partner accounts are business accounts that a channel manager uses to manage partner organizations, partner users, and activities. They are completely separate from account partnerships that are displayed in the Partners related list on an account. For more information about creating and managing partner portals, see Create and Manage Partner Portals. TIP If your organization uses person accounts, you can use partner roles to relate person accounts to each other. For example, if you have individual person account records for several members of a household or family, then you can use partner roles such as “Spouse” or “Sibling” to associate those records. Sharing Information with Partners Partners are companies or individuals that directly drive sales or help you close sales deals. Add Partner Relationships The opportunity and account detail pages include a Partners related list for viewing and adding partner relationships. Partner Fields A partner has the following fields, listed in alphabetical order. Deleting Partners Removing a partner from an opportunity or account removes the partner's relationship with the opportunity or account, but does not delete the account. Create a Partner Portal Starting in Summer ’13, the partner portal is no longer available for orgs that aren’t currently using it. Existing orgs continue to have full access. If you don’t have a partner portal, but want to easily share records and information with your partners, try Experience Cloud sites."

How Product Date Forecasts Differ from Close Date Forecasts When you forecast by product date, Salesforce uses the values from each opportunity product’s Date field and its Total Price, Quantity, or custom measure field to calculate forecasts. EXAMPLE A $10,000 opportunity has a close date of June 30, 2018 and two products: laptops for $4,000 and desktops for $6,000. The $4,000 product date is June 30, 2018. The $6,000 product date is May 31, 2018. If you forecast by close date, forecasts for the month of May don’t include an amount for this opportunity.

Understanding your team’s trends helps to gauge whether the team is tracking to hit their sales goals based on performance in previous periods. The information that’s available to you in the chart depends on enabled features and how long forecast data is retained. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions To review charts for a forecast, toggle to the Chart view on the forecasts page. You have access to charts for your forecasts across all forecast types and any of your subordinates. Here’s a Trends chart example where quota and cumulative category rollups are enabled. Depending on your system setup, your chart can look different. Each bar in the chart represents the same point in time in a previous period (month or quarter). In this example, the Today bar marks 45 days before the end of the current quarter. Other bars show the forecast when 45 days remained in each previous quarter. Metrics are shown to provide key information as of today. Where applicable, metrics also show the comparison to the last period and the same time last year. METRIC DESCRIPTION Quota Attainment Closed Won divided by quota. Closed Won Total value of opportunities that have been won and are now closed. Open Pipeline Opportunities that haven’t closed. Comparison Point The number of days remaining in the current period. This number is the point in the period that is used to compare the current period to the previous periods. If quota data isn’t available, the metrics that require quota aren’t shown. Bar Chart Segments For quarterly forecast periods, the chart includes five bars (one for each historical period over the last year, and one for today). For monthly forecasts, the chart includes 13 bars (12 bars for each historical month, and 1 bar for today). If you’re new to Salesforce, or only recently enabled historical trending, your chart contains data only for the periods that it has data for. Each forecast period segment shows opportunities grouped by the forecast category, including indicators for open pipeline and quota targets.

Contact your Salesforce account executive for more details. Accessing Sales Account Plans Access sales account plans from the Account Plans related list on the account home page. Or, from the App Launcher, search for Account Plans. Getting to Know Your Account Plan The sales account plan details page is your home for long-term account growth strategy planning. Review account KPIs (1), find an overview of the account plan details (2), and capture and evaluate customer needs (3). Determine and track measurable objectives (4), and go to the account’s buyer relationship map (5). Viewing Key Metrics on the Account Plan KPIs Dashboard The Account Plan KPIs dashboard shows the number of open opportunities by stage for an account. The dashboard shows up to 10 stages with the most open opportunities, but open opportunities in other stages are grouped in Other. Closed opportunities, both won and lost, aren’t included in the count of opportunities. You can’t customize the Account Plan KPIs dashboard. However, you can add your own dashboard by using Lightning App Builder. The Account Plan KPIs dashboard also provides these metrics. Revenue The sum of amounts from Closed Won opportunities for the quarter, either current or previous. Opportunity Win Rate The percentage of Closed Won opportunities for the quarter. The Opportunity Win Rate is calculated from Closed Won opportunities where the Amount field is populated. The number of Closed Won opportunities is divided by the total number of closed opportunities (both won and lost), and then the result is multiplied by 100. Identifying and Evaluating Account Needs In the SWOT Analysis panel, identify the account’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threads. This analysis helps remove barriers and implement new strategies for your long-term growth strategy. Format and organize your thoughts with the built-in rich text editor. In the Customer Landscape and Competitive Landscape panels, gather details that help your sales teams fully understand the account’s biggest areas of opportunity and risk within the marketplace. Identifying Potential Sales Opportunities with Product Whitespace The Product Whitespace map shows top-selling products from Closed Won opportunities across related accounts so that you can find potential products for upselling and cross-selling. By default, the map shows product data for the account associated with the account plan. When the account is part of a hierarchy, the map includes data for up to four other accounts closest to it in the hierarchy. You can’t customize the Product Whitespace map, but you can modify which information appears. To adjust the default view, click Account Hierarchy (1) and select up to 20 accounts to show.

The split on the Opportunity Amount field includes one revenue split and one overlay split type. If you want more split types, ask your admin to create them. Your admin specifies which types of splits always total 100%. Look for “must total 100%” in the description of the split. If you don’t see splits on a field, ask your admin to check your field-level security limits. To remove a team member from a split, click Del next to the team member’s name. To edit rich text fields or multiselect picklists, go to each team member’s opportunity split detail page. Your admin can’t include those kinds of fields in the Edit All Opportunity Splits window. When you enter a monetary amount that requires a split percentage with more than two decimal places, the amount is automatically rounded to two places. When an opportunity has overlay splits, changing the opportunity owner without keeping the opportunity team gives the new owner the sum of the previous owner’s split percentage. The new owner also gets the previous owner’s split percentage for the overlay split. You can’t insert or edit certain fields on opportunity splits of a certain opportunity split type, if product split records are set up on the opportunity for that split type. You also can’t delete any opportunity splits belonging to a split type that has product splits included on the opportunity. Opportunity splits don’t roll up to sales territories. In the Salesforce mobile app, the Split Amount field isn’t available, and other opportunity splits fields are read-only. Opportunity Product Splits When an opportunity is transferred to a new owner, the opportunity team can be transferred along with the associated product splits. When you delete all the products on an opportunity and the amount becomes 0, we roll up the changes to opportunity splits. The owner is assigned a 100% split and team members are assigned a 0% split. When you delete all the product splits on an opportunity, we roll up the changes to opportunity splits. The owner is assigned a 100% split and team members are assigned a 0% split.

You can’t define product splits on an opportunity for products with both positive and negative amounts if the rollup values in the Percentage field on the related opportunity split record will be outside of the allowed range of 0% to 100%.

Sally’s split on the same product is updated to 50%. This split scenario isn’t valid because the opportunity splits for the two reps are outside of the allowed range of 0-100%. When product splits are rolled up to the opportunity splits level, the amounts are limited to two decimal places. While the totals can be more precise with more decimal places, the values sometimes don’t add up to the exact value. For example, an opportunity with two products shows slightly different amounts based on the product split percentages. When you use product splits on revenue split types, you can’t have more than 200 products on an opportunity.

REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Contact Manager, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions General Contacts to Multiple Accounts is enabled via Setup and not via the Metadata API. The account in the Account Name field on a contact record is the contact’s primary account. The relationship between the contact and its primary account is a direct relationship. All other accounts that are related to the contact are indirect relationships. Disabling Contacts to Multiple Accounts deletes all indirect account-contact relationships. Associations between a contact and its primary account remain. To remove a direct relationship between a contact and an account, change the contact’s primary account or delete the contact. Most features continue to reference a contact’s primary account. For example, duplicate management uses the primary account when comparing records. For that reason, indirect account–contact relationships can’t be included in the matching criteria used to find duplicate records. Indirect contacts aren’t available in reports run from an Account & Contact standard report type. You can import account–contact relationships with the Data Loader but not with the Data Import Wizard. In Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app, the Add to Campaign action isn’t available on items in the Related Contacts related list on account records. To see the full related list and access the Add to Campaign mass action, click View All. If the Require permission to view record names in lookup fields setting is enabled, users don’t see names of related accounts that they don’t have access to in lookup fields. To show the data, give users read access to the record or the View All Lookup Record Names permission. See Require Permission to View Record Names in Lookup Fields. You can create Experience Cloud site users from Contacts to Multiple Accounts. To grant access to their records, configure a sharing set. Account Contact Relationships All direct contacts appear in the account record’s Related Contacts related list. But it’s possible that your admin removed the Contacts related list from your page layouts. When you have access to a particular account, the related contacts that you have Read access to appear in the Related Contacts related lists. When you have access to a particular contact, all related accounts appear in the Related Accounts related list. You can open the ones to which you have Read access. When creating indirect relationships between accounts and contacts, the contact must have a primary account—it can’t be a private contact. You can’t create a contact from the Account Contact Relationship detail page. Changing a contact’s primary account can trigger a workflow rule that changes the primary account to something else. In that event, Salesforce saves the relationship between the contact and the account you selected as an indirect relationship. Your admin controls the settings for saving previous relationships.

    "chunk_text": "most recently used items (such as a contact lookup field) only show direct relationships. When you remove indirect relationships, they’re deleted and can’t be restored from the Recycle Bin. If you delete a direct relationship, indirect relationships are removed. In this case, if the direct relationship is restored, the indirect relationship is also restored. When Contacts to Multiple Accounts is enabled, an Account Contact Relationship record is created for each contact with a primary account, and for each person account. Merging If you try to merge contacts that are indirectly related to the same account, an error message instructs you to remove the duplicate relationship. The same is true when merging accounts that are indirectly related to the same contact. The error message includes which account–contact relationships prevent the merge, regardless of whether you have access to the records. Without access to a record, you can’t navigate to it. When merging person accounts, indirect relationships with accounts and indirect relationships with contacts are evaluated separately. If you have conflicts with both, resolve the two errors separately. Microsoft Integration When syncing contacts between Salesforce and Microsoft Outlook, only the primary account relationship is synced. If you remove the account name from a contact in Outlook, the contact can’t sync to Salesforce if the contact has relationships to other accounts. Admin Settings What happens when you attempt to delete an account that includes direct contacts related to other accounts depends on what your admin has specified. You’re either blocked from deleting the account or allowed to delete the account. Deleting the account also deletes the account’s direct contacts, regardless of whether they have relationships to other accounts. When you change a contact’s primary account, Salesforce either deletes the previous account, or saves it as an indirect relationship. Your admin’s settings determine what happens to the previous account. Whether activities roll up to a contact’s parent account depends on what your admin specified in the activity settings.

Global actions aren’t supported. You can create actions that update records or invoke Lightning components or Visualforce pages. However, you can’t create actions that create records. You can’t create actions that send emails or log calls because the Account Contact Relationship object can’t have activities related to it. You can’t override the default actions on the Account Contact Relationship object. Only custom actions that are created on the Contact object can use the Account Contact Relationship object as a target object. Chatter standard actions aren’t supported because the Account Contact Relationship object doesn’t have a Chatter feed. Custom buttons are supported, but a custom button on a list view can’t have a Visualforce page as the content source."

When you align your campaign structure to your business processes and strategies, you can report ongoing marketing performance and ROI across activities and segments.

Use Salesforce campaigns to bridge the gap between marketing and sales and promote your successes to internal stakeholders. You can define campaign types, organize assets, add members, create campaign hierarchies, and then track and report on campaign performance. Tools like Campaign Influence and Einstein Attribution help attribute success and optimize future campaigns. Set Up Campaigns in Salesforce Salesforce campaigns help you track engagement and report on your marketing efforts. They’re fully customizable to meet your business needs, which means it takes some planning and a few steps to configure the Campaign object to support effective marketing campaigns. Working with Campaigns Salesforce campaign records support your team throughout the campaign lifecycle. Use campaigns to communicate and share resources with coworkers during planning and execution, and then monitor and report on campaign successes. Manage Campaign Members Add members to campaigns and update member statuses to keep your campaigns humming. Campaign Influence Understand how your campaigns are affecting your opportunity pipeline. Connect Account Engagement and Salesforce Campaigns If you’re new to Salesforce and Account Engagement, the Connected Campaigns feature is already partially enabled. Connect campaigns to save time, reduce clutter, and access valuable cross-product features. For example, work with Campaign Influence attribution models, Engagement History, and Einstein Campaign Insights for a complete view of your business. Plus, you can work with prospects and engagement data without leaving Salesforce. Leads Track prospects apart from your contacts and opportunities with Salesforce lead records. After you’ve qualified your lead records, convert them to contacts and create accounts for them (if you don’t already have the accounts in Salesforce).

Mapping custom fields helps your sales reps retain that important information when they convert qualified leads to track new potential deals. REQUIRED EDITIONS Available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic Available in: Starter, Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Pro Suite, and Developer Editions with Sales Cloud The following Lead custom field types can only be mapped to custom fields of the same data type. Checkbox Currency Date Date/Time Email Geolocation Encrypted (Classic) Number Percent Phone Multi-select Picklist Long Text Rich Text URL Each target field can have only one source field mapped to it. You can map auto-number fields to field types text or text area. You can map text and text area fields to custom field types of text, text area, long text, and picklist. If you map to a picklist field, the picklist must be unrestricted. You can map custom picklist fields to custom field types of text, text area, and picklist (unrestricted), but not long text. When mapping between picklist and text fields, your data truncates if the source field value is longer than the target field allows. Custom lookup fields can be mapped to a lookup field pointing to the same object. For example, a lead custom lookup field pointing to the Account object can be mapped to a contact custom lookup field that also points to the Account object. When mapping custom lead fields, the selected account, contact, or opportunity field must be of equal or greater length. You can’t delete lead, account, contact, or opportunity fields included in Lead Custom Field Mapping. To delete a field, first remove its mapping. You can’t change the field type of a field that’s included in Lead Custom Field Mapping. To change a field’s type, remove its mapping first. When you uninstall a package that references fields included in Lead Custom Field Mapping, those custom field mappings are deleted automatically. When mapping lead custom number, currency, or percent fields, the target field must have the same length and number of decimal places. If you have more than 500 lead fields, the lead field mapping page can become unresponsive. Dependent picklist fields on leads can’t have a default value assigned. These fields are driven from the value selected in the controlling picklist field. Field mappings defined between a controlling and dependent picklist are validated during lead conversion. These mappings don’t allow any values other than the current value of the controlling picklist to be assigned to the dependent picklist. In Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, custom field mapping for lead conversion is available in orgs that use APEX Lead Convert. Custom field mapping for lead convert is not available in orgs that use the older PLSQL Lead Convert. In orgs that use APEX Lead Convert, contact, account, and opportunity fields with field-level security settings are populated from mapped lead fields. NOTE Don’t"

View Other Users’ Forecasts Your position in the forecast hierarchy determines whose forecasts you can see. By default you see your forecast, which is made up of the reps and other forecast managers below you in the hierarchy. You can select other users below you in the hierarchy to view their forecasts. You cannot select people above you in the hierarchy. View Forecasts from Different Perspectives If your Salesforce admin activates multiple forecast types, select the forecasts that are relevant to you as tabs on the forecast page. Then, you can quickly access each tab to review your forecast from different perspectives. Review Recent Changes in Forecast Value To help you identify recent changes in value to a forecast, changes within the last 7 days are highlighted in the forecast summary. As a sales leader, you don’t want to be caught unaware of changes in your team’s forecast. Choose to show week-over-week changes for each forecast category so that you can adjust your sales and forecasting strategies accordingly. Review Pipeline Forecasts Against Forecast Quotas A forecast quota is the monthly or quarterly sales goal that’s assigned to a sales team member or territory. A manager’s quota equals the amount that the manager and team are expected to generate together. The quota rollup is done manually by users and managers, and revenue or quantity data can be used. If you have multiple types of forecasts enabled, each type maintains separate quota information. Opportunity Details in Pipeline Forecasts Review key guidelines for viewing the opportunity details on the forecasts page. Partner Portal User Opportunities in Pipeline Forecasts Partner portal users are external to your Salesforce org but sell your products and services through indirect sales channels. Your partner portal users use a portal to log in to Salesforce. Partners can create opportunities, and users can assign opportunities to them. Managing Common Pipeline Forecast Types Forecasts types specify how Salesforce calculates forecasts and projects sales from a different perspective. Learn about managing these common pipeline forecast types. Considerations for Managing Territory Pipeline Forecasts Before changing your active territory model, review how territory forecast data and performance can be affected."
